\chapter{Data \& Analysis}
In this chapter we will present the findings from our case study with a focus on themes relevant to our research questions. Each of the themes contain at least one extract with a context description, raw data from the transcript, and an explanation of the events that are unfolding. 

The first theme (\ref{cha:hypothesisgeneration}) is named \textit{Hypothesis generation and testing}. Here we will follow a hypothesis from generation to falsification to a new hypothesis. Then we move on to \textit{Guided inquiry} (\ref{cha:guidedinquiry}) where we will show examples of how misconceptions can either be addressed by the teacher or not, and how it can lead to hypothesis generation based on false premises. The third theme (\ref{cha:language}) is dubbed \textit{language} and presents three extracts regarding scientific and everyday language. The last theme (\ref{cha:linking}), \textit{linking between representations}, aims to show how the students relate the digital representation to the physical plant.  

For the sake of simplicity the first experiment where the plant was located in the window has been named plant A, and the second experiment where the plant was located in the cupboard, plant B.

\section{Hypothesis generation and testing}
\label{cha:hypothesisgeneration}
\subsection{First hypothesis}
\subsubsection*{Context}
\label{firsthypothesis}
We enter the situation at the beginning of class. The students have been divided into groups, and we are approximately two minutes into filming. Preceding this discussion, the students have tried for about one minute to figure out what the task is, and what the two experiments involved. Siri has read out loud the first question given to them: "what did you expect would happen?" (in the experiment), and they have repeated some of the theories presented in previous lectures (e.g soil moisture going down over time). Prior to the excerpt, the students have appeared a bit insecure about the task. But as we enter the setting they seem more focused and interested, and the discussion has changed from making general observations to generating hypotheses.

	\end{center}
	\caption{Hypothesis generation}
	\label{excerpt:hypothesisgeneration}
\end{table}

\subsubsection*{Explanation}
At first, Nora is not sure what would happen to the plant given green light in the cupboard (plant B). Siri, as one who thinks out loud, promptly starts reflecting on what could have happened. First she proposes that the plant was not only given green light, indicating that there could be error sources to the experiment. This is acknowledged by a slight nod by Nora. Then she goes on to reflect on the wavelengths plants absorb, and given that they only absorb a small amount of green light, the plant in the cupboard would not grow as much as plant A. Nora agrees to this hypothesis by nodding and saying "mmm". 

The basis for the statement that plants only absorb a small amount of green light can be found in the textbook: "reflected and transmitted light can hit our eyes and give the object color" \citep[pg. 103]{bios}. The book also contains a graph over the different pigments and which wavelengths of light they absorb, clearly showing little absorption of green light. In addition, the teacher has used this as a discussion point, asking why plants' leaves appear green. 

\subsection{Testing the hypothesis}

\subsubsection*{Context}
We enter the setting immediately after the excerpt explained in chapter \ref{firsthypothesis}. Siri has generated a hypothesis which she wants to test out. The mood in the group has now gone from laughter and insecurity about the task to concentration. The overall noise level in the class room has also fallen significantly.

		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Testing hypothesis}
	\label{excerpt:testinghypothesis}
\end{table}
\subsubsection*{Explanation}
After Siri has proposed the hypothesis that plant B would not grow as much as plant A, she wants to find out if it holds true. Suddenly she notices the plant which is placed on the table in front of them and exclaims, "is it that one(!)?". When Sjur confirms, the whole group and especially Siri look surprised. It seems like they all firmly believed the hypothesis Siri presented (see chapter \ref{firsthypothesis}) to hold true. And therefore, their knowledge of photosynthesis would also point to the plant not growing as much as it had. Thus, the first hypothesis generated by the group has been falsified. 

As a reaction to this Siri stops to think for a few seconds before she points at the window and asks: "were the stems on the one in the window also white?". This is a very valid scientific question, as a plant with absolutely no photosynthesis would most likely be white. A result of having no pigments. The reason for her asking this may be related to a comment made by another student in a previous lecture. He had observed that when they put plants in the basement for winter storage, the leaves would turn white. 

\subsection{A new hypothesis}
\subsubsection*{Context}
This next excerpt is from a situation occurring only a few seconds after the first hypothesis has been falsified. The group has been instructed to interact with the system on the computer in front of them to find the answer to the question asked at 2:59 "were the stems on the one in the window also white?". When we enter the situation they have a video of plant A on the screen, dated 31st of October, ready to play.

			\end{tabular}
		\end{center}
	\caption{A new hypothesis}
	\label{excerpt:newhypothesis}
\end{table}
\subsubsection*{Explanation}
Here Nora and Siri finds that the stem of plant A is white as well. Fredrik then states that there is not much difference between the two plants if they consider just the looks of them. Since Siri got that answer to her question about the stems, she has ruled out that photosynthesis is not happening in the cupboard. And so she formulates a new hypothesis which presumes an error source in the experiment: the plant has grown as much as it did because light of other wavelengths than green has entered the cupboard. 

This hypothesis would also explain why her first hypothesis, that the plant would not grow as much as the other, failed. It is also worth noting that monoplant does not provide a means of observing the wavelength of light, but we did however provide the students with a spectrometric image of the green light as shown in over the assignments.

\section{Guided inquiry}
\label{cha:guidedinquiry}

\subsection{Hypothesis generation based on misconception}

\subsubsection*{Context}
Prior to the following excerpt, the students have been looking at the movements of the two plants, and have observed that plant A window is moving towards the sun, a phenomenon called heliotropism. They are now observing the movements of plant B and Fredrik has just pointed out that it is growing straight up without any large movement like plant A. As we enter the setting, all the students are concentrated and watching a video of plant B from the 4th of November.

	\caption{Disconfirmation of growth}
	\label{excerpt:disconfirmation}
\end{table}

\subsubsection*{Explanation}
When Nora states that the plant is growing more in the cupboard, she is very cautious when introducing the idea, it seems like an unlikely observation. Siri approves and states that it is indeed growing more than plant A, Fredrik agrees and they all seem a bit puzzled by this observation.

Siri then starts to formulate a hypothesis for why plant B is growing more than plant A. Her reasoning is that heliotropism makes plant A grow slower because it has to move after the sun, and since plant B can grow straight up without following the sun, it grows faster. 

There is no indication that this hypothesis relates to anything she have read in the textbook, so it seems like the hypothesis is based on what she have seen in the system: plant A grows slowly and moves after the sun, while plant B grows faster and straight upwards. Since the students can't explain the phenomena with their current knowledge of photosynthesis, Siri turns to generating a hypothesis based on empirical data: what she is observing using Monoplant. However, as we will show in the next section, the students have a misconception which is that seeds need photosynthesis to grow.


\subsection{Scaffolding to fix misconception}

\subsubsection*{Context}
When we enter the situation, the teacher has been talking with the group for a couple of minutes. They have discussed that plant B grew more than plant A. The teacher is interested in knowing how they explain this, as they all thought the outcome would be the opposite (see chapter \ref{firsthypothesis} on page \pageref{firsthypothesis}). Siri has explained one of her hypotheses, that plant B might have received more than just green light, and if it only got green light it would probably not grow that much.  It is at this point we are entering the setting.

	\label{excerpt:teachertalk}
\end{table}

\subsubsection*{Explanation}
The excerpt starts with the teacher formulating a question in which he says: "a \textbf{seed} can't \textbf{germinate} and grow to become a plant without photosynthesis.. do you all think that?". In this sentence the teacher is describing what Siri have said in a way which leads the group to think outside the textbook model of photosynthesis. By using the words seed and germination (bold text in excerpt) he hints to the germination process. 

When the teacher have asked if this is what all the students think, Fredrik starts answering the question at once. He introduces the notion that there are plants that do not have photosynthesis but can grow from a seed nevertheless, hence that the seeds have an energy pack. This notion lays the basis for a discussion later on where the teacher leads the students to find out that seeds have starch as a food reserve, which makes seed growth (germination) possible. 

Up till this point in the session, the students had tried to generate and test hypotheses with what they know about photosynthesis or what they have observed in the system. They fail at generating valid hypotheses for why plant B has grown more than plant A because they think that seeds need photosynthesis to grow. This is fixed because of the teacher intervention, and at this point the students know that a seed can grow without photosynthesis and therefore without light.


\subsection{Misconception not followed}

\subsubsection*{Context}
The teacher is standing in front of the group asking them questions to make them reflect on different aspects of the photosynthesis. The conversation follows a pattern where the teacher asks a question, and the students answer. As we enter the setting, Siri has just presented a hypothesis. As the teacher asks for other explanations, all of the students are looking down on the textbook illustration of the light-dependent reaction placed on the table in front of them (see figure \ref{fig:lightdependentdetail}).

	\caption{Misconception not followed}
	\label{excerpt:misconceptionnotfollowed}
\end{table}

\subsubsection*{Explanation}
After the teacher has asked if there can be any other explanations, Nora takes the opportunity to ask the question: "...ehh can it be light as well?". As she asks the question, she points at the word "solar energy" in the illustration of the light-dependent reaction (see fig \ref{fig:lightdependentdetail} on page \pageref{fig:lightdependentdetail}). The teacher does not quite understand what she is asking, and therefore leans in and ask her to repeat the question. She then reformulates the question in a scientific language, asking if only sunlight can excite chlorophylls, and not artificial light. As she says the word "excite", she is pointing at the illustration of the chlorophyll molecule, and as she says "sun", she is pointing at the word "solar energy".

When Nora is asking these questions, she is clearly referring to the illustration in front of her. The reason for Nora asking this is that in the illustration, photons are labeled as "solar energy" . This is probably done by the authors to simplify the model, but in this case it leads to a big misconception. As we can see from her questions, she is unsure if artificial light can cause photosynthesis (which it can). If this were the case, Nora could rule out photosynthesis as the cause of the cupboard plant growing more than the window plant.

The teacher then proceeds to ask her if she means a lamp with green light, whereupon she confirms by saying "mmm". When the teacher replies that it is the question they are supposed to answer, she quickly replies that she meant artificial light, while pointing at the fluorescent lighting in the class room. The teacher then misinterprets, and think she is speaking of the specific lighting in the classroom, and not artificial light in general.

After Nora's question regarding the "erroneous" representation in the model, and the teachers failure to understand the motivation behind the question, the discussion quickly takes another turn. The question is left hanging, and is not followed up later in the session.  


\section{Language}
\label{cha:language}
\subsection{Teacher intervention}

\subsubsection*{Context}
The discussions preceding this excerpt has been a bit slow, leading us to intervene more in the situation, and asking them more questions. The students still seem interested and concentrated, with Siri taking the lead. The language used by the participants has up till this point been informal, and most utterances has been related to observations. A few seconds prior to the excerpt Sjur has instructed them to flip the paper sheet with the tasks, revealing an illustration from the textbook of the light-dependent reaction.

	\label{excerpt:teacherintervention}
\end{table}
\subsubsection*{Explanation}
When the teacher approaches the group, Siri's language quickly change from explaining things in everyday terms, to a more scientific language. After roughly 11 minutes of discussion, this is the first occurrence of the words \textit{excited}, \textit{clorophyl}, and \textit{molecules} (bold text in excerpt). 

One reason for the sudden change in language may be that only seconds before the excerpt, the students looked at the figure from the textbook, representing the light-dependent part of photosynthesis. This may have led Siri onto a more theoretical path, causing her to try and explain the phenomenon, using a scientific language. 

Another explanation may be that when the teacher asks a question, the students think he's assessing the answer. Thereby creating a test-like situation where Siri is eager to express her knowledge about the photosynthesis model explained in the textbook. 



\subsection{Everyday language}


\subsubsection*{Context}
When we enter the setting, the teacher has just left the group. Morten has asked the students to look at the videos of the two different experiments and see if there are any differences in their appearance. The students have looked at plant B and found that it is mostly the stem that grows, not the leaves. Fredrik has requested that they should check plant A to compare the two, and Siri has started the video from 29th of October, showing plant A. The group seems more motivated than in the previous excerpt (\ref{excerpt:teacherintervention}), \textit{teacher intervention}.

\subsubsection*{Explanation}
 First Siri mentions that the leaves are opening almost at once (compared to what they saw in the video from the cupboard). Fredrik approves, waits for the video to stop and then he states a hypothesis that the plant A needs leaves in order to "capture" the light, while plant B does not need any leaves. Siri asks if what he means is that plant B uses more food from the soil and the seed. Fredrik answers that plant B does not make use of the sunlight, hence it does not need that the leaves "pops out" that early. 

 The textbook explanation of this is that photosynthesis happens in the leaves. Photons get absorbed by different pigments which excite electrons, which again triggers the other parts of photosynthesis. Plants therefore needs leaves to have photosynthesis. Thus, the students are discussing a complex phenomenon using everyday language. Examples are (bold text in excerpt) \textit{capture} and \textit{use} instead of \textit{absorb}, and \textit{sunlight} instead of \textit{photons}. 

\subsection{Scientific language}
\subsubsection*{Context}
The students are working with task 3 regarding soil moisture and differences in absorption rate in the experiments. Most of the discussion has been concerned with making general observations, and they are struggling to form hypotheses. The main observation is that there are major differences in the absorption rate in the two experiments. In an effort to push the discussion further, Sjur has started to intervene, asking what it could mean in terms of photosynthesis that the soil moisture level drops less in the end of the experiment (see figure \ref{fig:soilmoistscreenshot} on page \pageref{fig:soilmoistscreenshot}). Approximately one minute before the excerpt, the teacher has tried to position himself discretely behind the group, but all the students except Linda has noticed him. As we enter the setting, Nora has taken the lead in the discussion.

\subsubsection*{Explanation}
After not having managed to explain the observation of difference in absorption rate in the two experiments, Nora suddenly switches to a more scientific language than in the minutes preceding this discussion. The words emphasized in bold can be found again both in the textbook and in language used by the teacher in earlier presentations of the material. 

There may be several reasons to this sudden change in language. First: Sjur has asked a question, and while she is saying this, she is looking at him as if he knows the answer, leading to a test-like situation. Second: the teacher is standing behind her listening to the whole situation. Or third: she is simply trying to bring in another representation as the students have not been able to explain the phenomena with the use the physical plant and the system. 


\section{Linking between representations}
\label{cha:linking}
\subsection{Soil moisture representation}


\subsubsection*{Context}
The students have read the introduction to assignment 3: \emph{"Look at the soil moisture graph for the whole period of the experiment. Plant A was sown 25th of October and plant B was sown 1st of November."} Siri has navigated to the soil moisture graph in the system, and got some help from Sjur to navigate the graph. Siri expanded the graph to include the lifespan of both plants and Sjur explained that this was indeed what they were looking at. Siri lets go of the mice and keyboard to read assignment 3a: \emph{Is there any difference in the absorption rate?} It is at this point we enter excerpt~\ref{excerpt:soilmoistureexcerpt}

	\caption{Screenshot from the soil moisture graph}
	\label{fig:soilmoistscreenshot}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Explanation}
Here the students are looking at Monoplant's representation of the soil moisture over time (see figure~\ref{fig:soilmoistscreenshot}). At first they are trying to interpret which part of the graph is which plant. First Nora shows by pointing with a V-shaped hand which part of the graph that represents plant A and plant B. Siri follows up and explains in an acknowledging way supporting the statement by pointing first to the left and then to the right. When this is confirmed and the students understand how the graph is divided between the two experiments, they start to interpret what the graph is saying. Nora observes and tell the others that the curves from the plant in the cupboard is much steeper than from the one in the window. The other students agree and Siri generates a hypothesis that the plant in the cupboard uses a lot more water, hence it seems like the students are interpreting the graph to show the water (h2o) usage of the plant. 

This might have several reasons, for example the textbook shows that plants use h2o in both the light dependent and the light independent reactions, so the students knows that h2o has a plays a central role in photosynthesis. There are also some constraints for interpretation in the system, foremost it is designed to represent a plant, hence it would be hard to interpret the soil moisture graph to not represent the life of the plant. Lastly there is the assignment: \emph{"Is there any difference in the \textbf{absorption} rate?"} By using the word absorption, we have constrained the interpretation of the graph and lead the students to focus on the plants absorption of h2o.
