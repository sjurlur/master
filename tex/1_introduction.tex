\chapter{Introduction}
In this master thesis we will look at how students can use a plant monitoring system called Monoplant to support their scientific inquiry when learning about photosynthesis.

\subsection{Monoplant}
Monoplant is a plant monitoring system we designed for this thesis. It can be used to log data about environmental variables surrounding a plant. The system reads data from sensors every minute and uploads the data to a server. A user can then access the gathered data through a website where timelapse videos and graphs are linked together, connecting visible changes of the plant to invisible changes in the environment.

\subsection{Users and testing}
We went to Foss VGS.

\subsection{Research questions}

\emph{"What characterizes the studentsâ€™ inquiry in interaction with Monoplant?"}

\emph{"How does Monoplant, by presenting photosynthesis differently from the text book, support the inquiry process?"}

\emph{"How is scaffolding operationalized in the environment?"}

\emph{"How does the institutional setting frame the students inquiry process?"}.
