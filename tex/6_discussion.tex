\chapter{Discussion}
In this chapter we will discuss our research question by contextualizing our findings to the analytical concepts introduced earlier in this thesis.

What characterizes the students’ inquiry in interaction with monoplant?
Here we can talk about: 
\begin{itemize}
\item{Inquiry learning and the problems. \citep{de1998scientific}}
\item{Misconceptions}
\item{Everyday language \& Scientific language}
\end{itemize}

\section{Multiple External Representations in Inquiry processes}

Here we can talk about: 
\begin{itemize}
\item{MER}
\item{Social practices}
\item{Everyday language \& Scientific language}
\end{itemize}

\section{Scaffolding}
How is scaffolding instantiated in the environment?
Here we can talk about: 
\begin{itemize}
\item{ZPD}
\item{Scaffolding}
\item{Inquiry learning}
\item{Misconceptions}

\end{itemize}

\section{Institutional setting}
How does the institutional setting frame the students inquiry process? (“doing school \& doing science”)
Here we can talk about: 
\begin{itemize}
\item{Institutional settings}
\item{Inquiry learning}
\item{Everyday language \& Scientific language}
\end{itemize}
