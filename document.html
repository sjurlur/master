<!--l. 6--><p class="noindent" >The collection of data material used in this thesis took part in the late autumn,
2013, at a high school located in the center of Oslo. The school is in the upper
third on the grade scale, with a limit of 43.5 points for admission in 2010/2011
(<a 
href="#Xutdanningsetaten">Utdanningsetaten</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xutdanningsetaten">2010</a>). Therefore the students at this school are mostly high
achievers.
<!--l. 8--><p class="indent" >   Contact with the school was first initiated through Intermedia, and a
presentational flier was sent as an explanation of the project (insert an appendix
ref here). Luckily our request coincided perfectly with a two-week time frame for
reviewing photosynthesis in one of the teacher&#8217;s biology classes. He was therefore
quite eager to swap out the experiment described in the textbook with an
experiment using our application.
<!--l. 10--><p class="indent" >   The class selected for the experiment was a biology class at the highest level
offered at the school, biology 2, which has an extensive curriculum covering e.g
photosynthesis, enzymes and energy transmitters (insert ref to photosynthesis
chapter). The students were between 17 and 18 years of age, and for the main
part most of the 20 students taking the class were present. All the students agreed
to participate in the study, but due to technical limitations and a busy time
schedule, most of the data collection was only done with a small sample of the
group.
<!--l. 12--><p class="noindent" >

   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.1.1.1   </span> <a 
 id="x1-50001.1.1.1"></a>Planning</h5>
<!--l. 14--><p class="noindent" >The planning of the project was done by us in conjunction with the teacher
responsible for the for the biology class. An initial planning meeting was held at
the school around one week prior to the experiments. There we gave the
teacher a thorough introduction of the system, and presented some ideas for
expirements the students could conduct using our system as platform. This
involved:
<!--l. 16--><p class="indent" >
      <ol  class="enumerate1" >
                                                                          

                                                                          
      <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-5002x1">Present the application in class
      </li>
      <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-5004x2">Initiate  an  experiment  using  the  application.  Related  to  e.g  soil
      moisture, light intensity, light quality, or temperature
      </li>
      <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-5006x3">Have a one hour session where the students work with text tasks related
      to the experiment</li></ol>
<!--l. 22--><p class="indent" >   The teacher then suggested that we could conduct two experiments, so the
students could work on the relations between the different external factors effect
on photosynthesis. As the system records a range of different variables, it would
be possible to keep the environment relatively controlled, or at least point to
factors which could be sources of error in the experiment.
<!--l. 24--><p class="indent" >   We agreed that the factor where we could get the most interesting result was
to vary the light intensity and the light quality (wavelength). The first experiment
would then involve keeping the plant located in a window facing west, receiving
sunlight and light from the fluorescent indoor-lighting. In the second experiment
we would plant new seeds, and relocate the plant to a (presumably) light proof
cupboard. The plant would then only be given green light with a known
wavelength. Each of the experiments would have a duration of approximately one
week.

   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.1.1.2   </span> <a 
 id="x1-60001.1.1.2"></a>The experiments</h5>
<!--l. 27--><p class="noindent" >The project was presented and the first experiment initiated by one of the
students on Friday 25th of October. This went on until Friday 1st of November
when the second experiment was initiated. The second experiment went on
until Wednesday 13th of November when the primary data collection
session took place. During the experiments we were present at four separate
occasions, observing what the teacher was focusing on, and which parts of the
photosynthesis the students found most difficult. In addition we were answering
questions about the system, and observed how the system was used by the teacher
and how the students related to it.

<!--l. 30--><p class="noindent" >The first experiment was conducted with a setup in the window as shown in
figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-7001r1">1.1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:windowplant --></a>. The system was located in the front of the classroom near a door
leading to the next classroom, this meant it was visible and in reach of everyone
walking by. The system was in the windowsill and there was a radiator located
on the wall just beneath the plant. The plant was exposed to sunlight
or daylight depending on the weather, but it was also exposed to the
fluorescent indoor-lighting in the ceiling. Due to the time of year, and
lack of people using the classroom in the evening, this meant that the
plant would get light in the period between 08:00 and about 17:00. It
turned out that the system was draining power from a power outlet that
was either connected to the light, or timer based, since the system went
down and did not post data between 19:00 and 07:00. We did also have
some technical issues with the system the weekend from 25th of October
to 27th of October, meaning that we missed data from the first seeds
germinating.

project. As our primary data source we chose video data with the use of multiple
cameras and a screen-dump. This was collected only during one session lasting 45
minutes, resulting in 3x45 minutes of video data and 1x45 minutes of audio
data. Supplementary data from this session includes the written answers
from the groups which were not filmed, and our personal notes of general
observations. In addition to this we were present at five occasions preceding the
session, taking notes. In the following sections the methods used will be
discussed.

<!--l. 56--><p class="noindent" >It was determined early in the project that video and audio recording were to be
used. Perhaps the primary reason for this was the tradition at Intermedia, as
video data collection has been used and thoroughly tested by a number of
researchers here. This meant that we would get a lot of help from co-located
researchers in what microphones to use, placement of cameras, operation of the
equipment, etc.

<!--l. 90--><p class="indent" >   For Interaction analysis to become a reality video and audio recording
technology has been a vital resource. The combination of recording talk as well as
nonverbal interaction and the ability to replay a sequence as many times as
necessary gives us the possibility to analyze more thoroughly. Combining this
micro-level data of interaction with ethnographic data gives us a means of
analyzing how the interaction is part of the situated context and institutional
practices. (<a

into groups, and we are approximately two minutes into filming. Preceding this
discussion, the students have tried for about one minute to figure out what the
task is, and what the two experiments involved. Siri has read out loud the first
question given to them: &#8221;what did you expect would happen?&#8221; (in the
experiment), and they have repeated some of the theories presented in
previous lectures (e.g soil moisture going down over time). Prior to the
excerpt, the students have appeared a bit insecure about the task. But
as we enter the setting they seem more focused and interested, and the
discussion has changed from making general observations to generating
hypotheses.

<!--l. 91--><p class="noindent" >At first, Nora is not sure what would happen to the plant given green light in the
cupboard (plant B). Siri, as one who thinks out loud, promptly starts reflecting on
what could have happened. First she proposes that the plant was not only given
green light, indicating that there could be error sources to the experiment. This
is acknowledged by a slight nod by Nora. Then she goes on to reflect
on the wavelengths plants absorb, and given that they only absorb a
small amount of green light, the plant in the cupboard would not grow as
much as plant A. Nora agrees to this hypothesis by nodding and saying
&#8221;mmm&#8221;.
<!--l. 93--><p class="indent" >   The basis for the statement that plants only absorb a small amount of green
light can be found in the textbook: &#8221;reflected and transmitted light can hit our
eyes and give the object color&#8221; (<a 
href="#Xbios">Sletbakk et&#x00A0;al.</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xbios">2008</a>, pg. 103). The book also
contains a graph over the different pigments and which wavelengths of light they
absorb, clearly showing little absorption of green light. In addition, the
teacher has used this as a discussion point, asking why plants&#8217; leaves appear
green.

<!--l. 140--><p class="noindent" >After Siri has proposed the hypothesis that plant B would not grow as much as
plant A, she wants to find out if it holds true. Suddenly she notices the
plant which is placed on the table in front of them and exclaims, &#8221;is it
that one(!)?&#8221;. When Sjur confirms, the whole group and especially Siri
look surprised. It seems like they all firmly believed the hypothesis Siri
presented (see chapter <a 
href="#x1-210002.1.1">2.1.1<!--tex4ht:ref: firsthypothesis --></a>) to hold true. And therefore, their knowledge
of photosynthesis would also point to the plant not growing as much
as it had. Thus, the first hypothesis generated by the group has been
falsified.
<!--l. 142--><p class="indent" >   As a reaction to this Siri stops to think for a few seconds before she points at
the window and asks: &#8221;were the stems on the one in the window also
white?&#8221;. This is a very valid scientific question, as a plant with absolutely no
photosynthesis would most likely be white. A result of having no pigments. The
reason for her asking this may be related to a comment made by another student
in a previous lecture. He had observed that when they put plants in the basement
for winter storage, the leaves would turn white.

hypothesis has been falsified. The group has been instructed to interact with the
system on the computer in front of them to find the answer to the question asked
at 2:59 &#8221;were the stems on the one in the window also white?&#8221;. When we enter
the situation they have a video of plant A on the screen, dated 31st of October,
ready to play.

<!--l. 183--><p class="noindent" >Here Nora and Siri finds that the stem of plant A is white as well. Fredrik
then states that there is not much difference between the two plants if
they consider just the looks of them. Since Siri got that answer to her
question about the stems, she has ruled out that photosynthesis is not
happening in the cupboard. And so she formulates a new hypothesis which
presumes an error source in the experiment: the plant has grown as much
as it did because light of other wavelengths than green has entered the
cupboard.
<!--l. 185--><p class="indent" >   This hypothesis would also explain why her first hypothesis, that the plant
would not grow as much as the other, failed. It is also worth noting that
monoplant does not provide a means of observing the wavelength of light, but we
did however provide the students with a spectrometer image of the green light as
shown in over the assignments.

<!--l. 193--><p class="noindent" >Prior to the following excerpt, the students have been looking at the movements
of the two plants, and have observed that plant A window is moving towards the
sun, a phenomenon called heliotropism. They are now observing the movements of
plant B and Fredrik has just pointed out that it is growing straight up
without any large movement like plant A. As we enter the setting, all the
students are concentrated and watching a video of plant B from the 4th of
November.

<!--l. 263--><p class="noindent" >When Nora states that the plant is growing more in the cupboard, she is very
cautious when introducing the idea, it seems like an unlikely observation. Siri
approves and states that it is indeed growing more than plant A, Fredrik agrees
and they all seem a bit puzzled by this observation.
<!--l. 265--><p class="indent" >   Siri then starts to formulate a hypothesis for why plant B is growing more
than plant A. Her reasoning is that heliotropism makes plant A grow slower
because it has to move after the sun, and since plant B can grow straight up
without following the sun, it grows faster.
<!--l. 267--><p class="indent" >   There is no indication that this hypothesis relates to anything she have read
in the textbook, so it seems like the hypothesis is based on what she
have seen in the system: plant A grows slowly and moves after the sun,
while plant B grows faster and straight upwards. Since the students can&#8217;t
explain the phenomena with their current knowledge of photosynthesis, Siri
turns to generating a hypothesis based on empirical data: what she is
observing using Monoplant. However, as we will show in the next section, the
students have a misconception which is that seeds need photosynthesis to
grow.

<!--l. 273--><p class="noindent" >When we enter the situation, the teacher has been talking with the group for a
couple of minutes. They have discussed that plant B grew more than
plant A. The teacher is interested in knowing how they explain this, as
they all thought the outcome would be the opposite (see chapter <a 
href="#x1-210002.1.1">2.1.1<!--tex4ht:ref: firsthypothesis --></a> on
page <span class="pageref"><a

have received more than just green light, and if it only got green light it
would probably not grow that much. It is at this point we are entering the
setting.

you all think that?&#8221;. In this sentence the teacher is describing what Siri have said
in a way which leads the group to think outside the textbook model of
photosynthesis. By using the words seed and germination (bold text in excerpt) he
hints to the germination process.
<!--l. 319--><p class="indent" >   When the teacher have asked if this is what all the students think, Fredrik
starts answering the question at once. He introduces the notion that there are
plants that do not have photosynthesis but can grow from a seed nevertheless,
hence that the seeds have an energy pack. This notion lays the basis for a
discussion later on where the teacher leads the students to find out that seeds
have starch as a food reserve, which makes seed growth (germination)
possible.
<!--l. 321--><p class="indent" >   Up till this point in the session, the students had tried to generate and test
hypotheses with what they know about photosynthesis or what they have
observed in the system. They fail at generating valid hypotheses for why plant B
has grown more than plant A because they think that seeds need photosynthesis
to grow. This is fixed because of the teacher intervention, and at this point the
students know that a seed can grow without photosynthesis and therefore without
light.

 id="x1-440002.2.3"></a>Explanation</h5>
<!--l. 411--><p class="noindent" >After the teacher has asked if there can be any other explanations, Nora takes the
opportunity to ask the question: &#8221;...ehh can it be light as well?&#8221;. As she asks the
question, she points at the word &#8221;solar energy&#8221; in the illustration of the
light-dependent reaction (see fig <a 
href="#x1-40001r1">2.1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:lightdependentdetail --></a> on page <span class="pageref"><a 
href="#x1-40001r1"><span 
class="tcrm-1200">§</span></a></span>). The teacher does not
quite understand what she is asking, and therefore leans in and ask her to
repeat the question. She then reformulates the question in a scientific
language, asking if only sunlight can excite chlorophyll, and not artificial light.
As she says the word &#8221;excite&#8221;, she is pointing at the illustration of the
chlorophyll molecule, and as she says &#8221;sun&#8221;, she is pointing at the word &#8221;solar
energy&#8221;.
<!--l. 413--><p class="indent" >   When Nora is asking these questions, she is clearly referring to the illustration
in front of her. The reason for Nora asking this is that in the illustration, photons
are labeled as &#8221;solar energy&#8221; . This is probably done by the authors to
simplify the model, but in this case it leads to a big misconception. As
we can see from her questions, she is unsure if artificial light can cause
photosynthesis (which it can). If this were the case, Nora could rule out
photosynthesis as the cause of the cupboard plant growing more than the window
plant.
<!--l. 415--><p class="indent" >   The teacher then proceeds to ask her if she means a lamp with green light,
whereupon she confirms by saying &#8221;mmm&#8221;. When the teacher replies that it is the
question they are supposed to answer, she quickly replies that she meant artificial
light, while pointing at the fluorescent lighting in the class room. The teacher then
misinterprets, and think she is speaking of the specific lighting in the classroom,
and not artificial light in general.
<!--l. 417--><p class="indent" >   After Nora&#8217;s question regarding the &#8221;erroneous&#8221; representation in the model,
and the teachers failure to understand the motivation behind the question, the
discussion quickly takes another turn. The question is left hanging, and is not
followed up later in the session.

<!--l. 425--><p class="noindent" >The discussions preceding this excerpt has been a bit slow, leading us to intervene
more in the situation, and asking them more questions. The students
still seem interested and concentrated, with Siri taking the lead. The
language used by the participants has up till this point been informal, and
most utterances has been related to observations. A few seconds prior to
the excerpt Sjur has instructed them to flip the paper sheet with the
tasks, revealing an illustration from the textbook of the light-dependent
reaction.

<!--l. 466--><p class="noindent" >When the teacher approaches the group, Siri&#8217;s language quickly change from
explaining things in everyday terms, to a more scientific language. After roughly
11 minutes of discussion, this is the first occurrence of the words <span 
class="cmti-12">excited</span>,
<span 
class="cmti-12">chlorophyll</span>, and <span 
class="cmti-12">molecules </span>(bold text in excerpt).
<!--l. 468--><p class="indent" >   One reason for the sudden change in language may be that only seconds before
the excerpt, the students looked at the figure from the textbook, representing the
light-dependent part of photosynthesis. This may have led Siri onto a more
theoretical path, causing her to try and explain the phenomenon, using a scientific
language.
<!--l. 470--><p class="indent" >   Another explanation may be that when the teacher asks a question, the
students think he&#8217;s assessing the answer. Thereby creating a test-like situation
where Siri is eager to express her knowledge about the photosynthesis model
explained in the textbook.

the students to look at the videos of the two different experiments and see if there
are any differences in their appearance. The students have looked at plant B
and found that it is mostly the stem that grows, not the leaves. Fredrik
has requested that they should check plant A to compare the two, and
Siri has started the video from 29th of October, showing plant A. The
group seems more motivated than in the previous excerpt (<a

<!--l. 523--><p class="noindent" >First Siri mentions that the leaves are opening almost at once (compared to what
they saw in the video from the cupboard). Fredrik approves, waits for the
video to stop and then he states a hypothesis that the plant A needs
leaves in order to &#8221;capture&#8221; the light, while plant B does not need any
leaves. Siri asks if what he means is that plant B uses more food from
the soil and the seed. Fredrik answers that plant B does not make use
of the sunlight, hence it does not need that the leaves &#8221;pops out&#8221; that
early.
<!--l. 525--><p class="indent" >   The textbook explanation of this is that photosynthesis happens in the
leaves. Photons get absorbed by different pigments which excite electrons,
which again triggers the other parts of photosynthesis. Plants therefore
needs leaves to have photosynthesis. Thus, the students are discussing a
complex phenomenon using everyday language. Examples are (bold text

absorption rate in the experiments. Most of the discussion has been concerned
with making general observations, and they are struggling to form hypotheses.
The main observation is that there are major differences in the absorption rate in
the two experiments. In an effort to push the discussion further, Sjur has started
to intervene, asking what it could mean in terms of photosynthesis that the soil
moisture level drops less in the end of the experiment (see figure <a

<!--l. 578--><p class="noindent" >After not having managed to explain the observation of difference in absorption
rate in the two experiments, Nora suddenly switches to a more scientific language
than in the minutes preceding this discussion. The words emphasized in bold can
be found again both in the textbook and in language used by the teacher in
earlier presentations of the material.
<!--l. 580--><p class="indent" >   There may be several reasons to this sudden change in language. First: Sjur
has asked a question, and while she is saying this, she is looking at him as if he
knows the answer, leading to a test-like situation. Second: the teacher is
standing behind her listening to the whole situation. Or third: she is simply
trying to bring in another representation as the students have not been
able to explain the phenomena with the use the physical plant and the
system.

<!--l. 654--><p class="noindent" >Here the students are looking at Monoplant&#8217;s representation of the soil moisture
over time (see figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-61002r2">2.2<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:soilmoistscreenshot --></a>). At first they are trying to interpret which part of the
graph is which plant. First Nora shows by pointing with a V-shaped hand which
part of the graph that represents plant A and plant B. Siri follows up and explains
in an acknowledging way supporting the statement by pointing first to the left
and then to the right. When this is confirmed and the students understand how
the graph is divided between the two experiments, they start to interpret what
the graph is saying. Nora observes and tell the others that the curves
from the plant in the cupboard is much steeper than from the one in the
window. The other students agree and Siri generates a hypothesis that
the plant in the cupboard uses a lot more water, hence it seems like the
students are interpreting the graph to show the water (h2o) usage of the
plant.
<!--l. 656--><p class="indent" >   This might have several reasons, for example the textbook shows that
plants use h2o in both the light dependent and the light independent
reactions, so the students knows that h2o has a plays a central role in
photosynthesis. There are also some constraints for interpretation in the system,
foremost it is designed to represent a plant, hence it would be hard to
interpret the soil moisture graph to not represent the life of the plant. Lastly
there is the assignment: <span 
class="cmti-12">&#8221;Is there any difference in the </span><span 
class="cmbxti-10x-x-120">absorption </span><span 
class="cmti-12">rate?&#8221;</span>
By using the word absorption, we have constrained the interpretation
of the graph and lead the students to focus on the plants absorption of
h2o.
