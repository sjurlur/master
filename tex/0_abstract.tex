\begin{abstract}
The purpouse of this research was to explore how students interact and learn with our scientific inquiry-system, Monoplant. The system is an Internet-connected plant, visualizing different aspects of plant biology through a web-interface. The study investigates how the system affects the educational context and how it supports the students' inquiry process.  We performed a design experiment where a biology class performed science experiments using our system. Our data material consists of video from a session where groups of students worked with questions related to the experiments. We are positioned within the sociocultural perspective and maintain a focus on how the institutional aspects of the school affect the learning process. The findings indicate that multiple representations should be used in scientific inquiry, inquiry learning can lead to scientific misconceptions, and that students have difficulties combining the requirements of the school with the scientific inquiry process.
