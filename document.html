<!--l. 7--><p class="noindent" >This thesis is positioned within the research field of computer-supported
collaborative learning (CSCL). The field is concerned with how people learn
together with the use of technology, both distributed and co-located. This also
includes how we design technology for collaborative learning, and how
we understand the actions and activities mediated by information and
communication technology (ICT) (<a

<!--l. 9--><p class="indent" >   The field emerged in the 1990s as reaction to &#8221;...software that forced students
to learn as isolated individuals&#8221; (<a 
href="#Xstahl2006computer">Stahl et&#x00A0;al.</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xstahl2006computer">2006</a>). In a knowledge-based
society we need to learn complex, domain-specific skills and the ability to
work in teams. These skills are difficult to teach through memorizing and
fact-finding (<a

is therefore concerned with &#8221;teaching and learning the knowledge and
skills required for participation in the knowledge-based society in concert
with the basic skills they rely upon&#8221; (<a

<!--l. 12--><p class="noindent" >The first part of CSCL, computer-support, directs focus on how technology can
be designed for educational contexts. This acknowledges that computer support
holds some features that demand more than simply transferring analog content to
digital platforms. <a 
href="#Xstahl2006computer">Stahl et&#x00A0;al.</a>&#x00A0;(<a 
href="#Xstahl2006computer">2006</a>) presented a number of differences between
CSCL and traditional views of e-learning.
<!--l. 14--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">First</span>, the idea that digitalizing educational content automatically makes for
compelling instructions is challenged. While digital content can prove beneficial
as resources for students, it can only be effective within a larger motivational and
interactive context. <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">Second</span>, although online teaching provides opportunities for
distributed learning, it requires at least as much effort by human teachers as
classroom teaching. <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">Third</span>, CSCL stresses collaboration among students
and aims to promote design of systems that stimulate and support the
collaborative process. <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">Fourth</span>, CSCL acknowledges the value of face-to-face
                                                                     <img

collaboration. Computer-support can involve co-located learning where the
technology is used as a mediational means in the interaction between
students.

 id="x1-40001.1.2"></a>Collaborative learning</h4>
<!--l. 17--><p class="noindent" >The second part of CSCL, collaborative learning, directs focus on learning in
groups. In order to understand what this entails, a useful distinction is made
between the seemingly synonymous terms <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">cooperative </span>and <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">collaborative</span>.
<a 
href="#Xdillenbourg1999you">Dillenbourg</a>&#x00A0;(<a 
href="#Xdillenbourg1999you">1999</a>) refers to the distinction with division of labor in mind,
stating: &#8221;In cooperation, partners split the work, solve subtasks individually and
then assemble the partial results into the final output&#8221; (<a 
href="#Xdillenbourg1999you">Dillenbourg</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xdillenbourg1999you">1999</a>,
p. 8). This is opposed to collaboration where &#8221;...partners do the work
&#8217;together&#8217;&#8221; (<a 
href="#Xdillenbourg1999you">Dillenbourg</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xdillenbourg1999you">1999</a>). This implies that the students together
construct the knowledge needed for solving the task at hand. Learning
is then seen as something that happens socially, within a group (<a 
href="#Xstahl2006computer">Stahl

 id="x1-50001.1.3"></a>CSCL-research</h4>
<!--l. 20--><p class="noindent" >The goal of CSCL-research is two-fold. On one hand, the field is concerned with
creating (digital) artifacts that can be used within learning, and creating learning
environments that enhance the practices of group meaning making (<a 
href="#Xstahl2006computer">Stahl
et&#x00A0;al.</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xstahl2006computer">2006</a>). On the other, the &#8221;technology does not exist independent of its
use&#8221; (<a 
href="#XLeBaron2002">LeBaron</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XLeBaron2002">2002</a> referenced in&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xstahl2006computer">Stahl et&#x00A0;al.</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xstahl2006computer">2006</a>), and the design of
software must therefore be done in concert with analysis of the meanings
constructed within emergent practice. In order to design computer support for
collaborative learning, we therefore need to understand how students
collaboratively construct shared meaning in interaction with artifacts.
As collaboration depends on externalization of thought, the students
must negotiate their meaning making by displaying their understanding.
Researchers can then use these interactions as data to be analyzed (<a 
href="#Xstahl2006computer">Stahl
et&#x00A0;al.</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xstahl2006computer">2006</a>).
<!--l. 22--><p class="indent" >   While CSCL does not provide an established body of broadly accepted
laboratory and classroom practices, it does provide a vision of what can be done
with the help of computers, and what kind of research should be conducted
(<a 
href="#Xludvigsen2010computer">Ludvigsen and&#x00A0;Mørch</a>,&#x00A0;<a

href="#Xstahl2006computer">Stahl et&#x00A0;al.</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xstahl2006computer">2006</a>). In the work with Monoplant,
we have positioned ourselves within the field. The theoretical concepts,
methodology and methods applied in this thesis are therefore inspired by related
work by other CSCL-researchers.
                                                                     <img

<!--l. 75--><p class="noindent" >In a biological sense the human species has not evolved significantly the last ten
thousand years or so. In fact, changes in our gene pool are only minor, and
cannot explain the differences between modern people and people of the Stone
Age. Still we are able to achieve tasks that would have been impossible for our
ancestors (<a 
href="#Xsaljo2001laering">Säljö</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xsaljo2001laering">2001</a>).
<!--l. 77--><p class="indent" >   The explanation of this discrepancy from a sociocultural perspective becomes
evident when one take into account the <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">tools </span>and <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">signs </span>we use to mediate the
world. We have created a culture where each of the tools and signs we use has a
long history embedded in them. If you are given the multiplication problem
122 <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">&#x00D7; </span>284, you can flip up a calculator and get the answer instantaneously.
Similarly, if you were to solve the multiplication problem 7 <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">&#x00D7; </span>4 you can look
up in a multiplication table and find the answer easily. These <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">cultural</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">tools </span>(calculator and multiplication table), with knowledge embedded in
them, enables you to make sense of the world in a different way than our
ancestors.
<!--l. 79--><p class="indent" >   From the example given above we can see that there is an &#8220;irreducible
tension&#8221; between the agent and the cultural tool (<a 
href="#Xwertsch1998mind">Wertsch</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xwertsch1998mind">1998</a>). Without the
multiplication table you would not be able to solve the problem. But
the multiplication table is not enough, as it would have been useless
without a skilled user. The goal of a sociocultural approach is therefore
to:
<!--l. 81--><p class="indent" >
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 82--><p class="noindent" >...Create an account of human mental processes that recognizes

href="#Xwertsch1991voices">1991</a>, p.
     6).</div>
<!--l. 85--><p class="indent" >   This means that the unit of analysis is human action, and how it is mediated
by cultural tools, or &#8220;agent-acting-with-mediational-means&#8221; (<a

href="#Xwertsch1998mind">Wertsch</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xwertsch1998mind">1998</a>). The mediated action can never be
understood by the properties of only the agent, the mediational means, or the
cultural, historical and institutional setting of the mediated activity. An example
of this is H<sub><span 
class="cmr-8">2</span></sub>O: one cannot understand what makes up water if one analyzes
hydrogen and oxygen separately. The characteristic of the whole is not made up
by the characteristics of the elements (<a

href="#Xvygotskiui1978mind">1978</a>). Another example
is the track-and-field event of pole vaulting.
     <div class="quote">
                                                                     <img

     <!--l. 87--><p class="noindent" >The pole by itself does not magically propel vaulters over a cross
     bar; it must be used skillfully by the agent. At the same time, an
     agent without a pole or with an inappropriate pole is incapable
     of participating in the event (<a

<!--l. 89--><p class="noindent" >So while analysis of the elements in isolation may be informative, we will never

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.2.1   </span> <a 
 id="x1-70001.2.1"></a>Tools and signs</h4>
<!--l. 92--><p class="noindent" >One important distinction to make when talking about mediated activity is that
of tools (physical tools) and signs (psychological tools) (<a 
href="#Xvygotskiui1978mind">Vygotski&#x012D; et&#x00A0;al.</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xvygotskiui1978mind">1978</a>).
While they are similar in that they can play a mediating role in activity, they are
different in the ways they orient human behavior. The tool is externally oriented
and must lead to change in physical objects. A basic example of a tool is a
hammer. An agent can mediate her activity toward the external world by
using the tool to crush a coconut. A sign on the other hand is internally
oriented and &#8221;changes nothing in the object of psychological operation&#8221;
(<a 
href="#Xvygotskiui1978mind">Vygotski&#x012D; et&#x00A0;al.</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xvygotskiui1978mind">1978</a>, p. 55). Examples of signs are: diagrams, drawings,
language, or as mentioned above, multiplication tables. &#8220;It is a means of
internal activity aimed at mastering oneself&#8221; (<a 
href="#Xvygotskiui1978mind">Vygotski&#x012D; et&#x00A0;al.</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xvygotskiui1978mind">1978</a>, p.
55).
<!--l. 94--><p class="indent" >   Another illuminating example of the difference between tools and signs is that
of a child presented with a birthday cake. The child does not immediately start
eating, but waits until &#8220;happy birthday&#8221; has been sung and she has blown out
the candles. In that sense the cake is a sign as it represents a lot more than just
food in the mind of the child. It signifies that she is a year older, that
she is going to get presents afterwards, that she is celebrated, etc. On
the other hand, from the parents&#8217; point of view, the cake can be used
to signify that she is a year older and has new responsibilities in the
society.
<!--l. 96--><p class="indent" >   If we look at the same example from a behavioristic point of view, another
situation emerge. The behavioristic model focuses on the role of the individual
and the notion that knowledge arises through individual drill and practice. The
girl would therefore know from previous experience that cake tastes good, and
immediately start to dig in.
<!--l. 98--><p class="indent" >   In contrast, the cognitive model focuses on thought processes and the notion
that the environment provides raw material for testing innately conceived
hypotheses. The reason for the girl not eating the cake would therefore be an
internal thought process, and the context in which the cake is placed would play
a minor role.
                                                                     <img

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.2.2   </span> <a 
 id="x1-80001.2.2"></a>Implications for learning</h4>
<!--l. 101--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;From a sociocultural perspective learning is understood as mastery and
appropriation of cultural tools&#8221; (Wertsch, 1998, Säljö, 1999, 2001, cited in <a 
href="#Xmifsud2010reconsidering">Mifsud
and&#x00A0;Mørch</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xmifsud2010reconsidering">2010</a>, p. 152). <a 
href="#Xwertsch1998mind">Wertsch</a>&#x00A0;(<a 
href="#Xwertsch1998mind">1998</a>) does however make a distinction
between knowing how to use a cultural tool (mastery) and making a cultural tool
one&#8217;s own (appropriation). Appropriation can be to take the mastery one step
further. Oxford dictionary defines it as &#8220;the action of taking something for one&#8217;s
own use&#8221;, or as <a 
href="#Xwertsch1998mind">Wertsch</a>&#x00A0;(<a 
href="#Xwertsch1998mind">1998</a>, p. 145) puts it: &#8220;making a cultural tool one&#8217;s
own&#8221;. One example of this is a person who has mastered the cultural tool
&#8221;chords&#8221; on a guitar and later appropriates them to a song. It should however be
recognized that both mastery and appropriation does not always happen. For
example, a person could master the chords on the guitar and perform them
flawlessly in class, but dismiss them as terribly ugly at home. Likewise, a
person can appropriate chords to a song without mastering the chords
themselves.
<!--l. 103--><p class="indent" >   When we are asking what learning is from a sociocultural perspective, we are
also asking which cultural tools are valued, and in which contexts do they apply
(<a 
href="#Xmifsud2010reconsidering">Mifsud and&#x00A0;Mørch</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xmifsud2010reconsidering">2010</a>). In order to give an answer to these questions, we
have to take into account the cultural, historical and institutional context of the
mediated activity.
<!--l. 105--><p class="indent" >   To set the scope for our thesis we have decided to place an emphasis on the
institutional part of the context, while still acknowledging that the context also
has cultural and historical aspects.

<!--l. 108--><p class="noindent" >With a sociocultural perspective on learning, we see external and internal
processes as intertwined. By this we try to see student interactions with artifact
and each other as embedded in a cultural, historical and institutional practice,
meaning that we take into account the relation between the mediational means,

tools that enable the teacher to supervise the students, assignments that
makes the students think as if they are being assessed, or tools for the

<!--l. 125--><p class="noindent" >In the early stages of life, children learn for the most part by experience. Skills
such as mastering the native language, walking, and running are learned
through trial and error. This means that the knowledge of a concept
is linked to the concrete experience where the concept was presented.
A child who is presented with the concept of &#8221;brother&#8221; by a pointing
gesture toward her brother, will at first only associate the word &#8221;brother&#8221;
with that specific person. This is what <a

<span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">concept</span>.
<!--l. 127--><p class="indent" >   An only child on the other hand, will be introduced to the concept of brother
through other concepts. A parent can for instance say that &#8221;brothers are
boys who have the same parents&#8221;. The concept of brother will then be a
general concept for the child, not linked to any concrete experiences, but to
the concepts of &#8221;boys&#8221; and &#8221;parents&#8221;. This is what <a 
href="#Xvygotsky2012thought">Vygotski&#x012D;</a> calls a
<span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">scientificconcept</span>.
<!--l. 129--><p class="indent" >   Spontaneous concepts are developed outside the conceptual framework
and only linked to concrete experiences in the mind of the learner. If
we presented the child having a brother with the abstract problem of a
&#8221;brother&#8217;s brother&#8221; (<a 
href="#Xvygotsky2012thought">Vygotski&#x012D;</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xvygotsky2012thought">2012</a>) he would become confused, as his
only knowledge of the concept of brother is in situations with his own
brother.
<!--l. 131--><p class="indent" >   In contrast, scientific concepts are developed within a conceptual framework.
They are immediately given a place within the system of concepts, i.e., explained
by their relation to other concepts. As a result, the child is consciously aware and
                                                                     <img

child with the abstract problem of a &#8221;brother&#8217;s brother&#8221;, he would most likely be
able to solve it because of the concept&#8217;s relation to other concepts in the mind of
the child.
<!--l. 133--><p class="indent" >   Another example is how children develop a concept of time. In the
early stages of life, a child may think that day and night is analogous to
light and darkness. This is the spontaneous concept, which is saturated
by experience. It is only later in life he learns the scientific concepts of
the earth&#8217;s rotation and its relation to the sun and the moon, which
marks days and years. This information has not been appropriated by
experience, as the child has not been to space and experienced it, the
information is constructed using different signs linked together by the
instructor.

<!--l. 142--><p class="indent" >   The relationship between these two categories can be explained as
an inverted pyramid. On the top we have the scientific concepts, which
are general and abstract. And on the bottom we have the spontaneous
concepts, which are specific and concrete. The concepts then move toward
each other. The scientific concepts move downwards &#8221;toward greater
concreteness&#8221; in a deductive manner, whereas the spontaneous concepts move
&#8221;upward toward greater abstractness&#8221; (<a 
href="#Xvygotsky2012thought">Vygotski&#x012D;</a>,&#x00A0;<a

manner.
<!--l. 144--><p class="indent" >   Even though the concepts move in opposite directions, there is a mutual
dependency between them. In Vygotski&#x012D;&#8217;s terms: &#8221;In working its slow way
upwards, an everyday concept clears a path for a scientific concept and
its downward development&#8221;. This means that &#8221;...the development of
a spontaneous concept must have reached a certain level for the child
to be able to absorb a related scientific concept&#8221; (<a

href="#Xvygotsky2012thought">2012</a>, p.
194). It is therefore essential for the teacher to bring the spontaneous
concepts up to a level that makes the scientific concept within reach for the
student. By doing this, the student will have the experience, and the
related concepts necessary for constructing knowledge of an abstract
concept.
<!--l. 146--><p class="indent" >   This brings us to the zone of proximal development, as students who lack
consciousness and control over the spontaneous concepts can &#8221;...find this

<!--l. 161--><p class="indent" >   The actual developmental level is in other words determined by looking at
what a person can do alone. Vygotski&#x012D; found that this traditional way of
determining a person&#8217;s mental development does not hold in school learning, as it
only describes what functions in a person that have already been matured. He
therefore introduces a new developmental level, the potential development,
which can describe the functions in a person that are in the process of
maturation. The actual development is therefore the end product of developing,
while the potential development is the state and process of developing.
Teachers and instructors can then use the ZPD as a tool to delineate
the immediate future of their students, i.e., their actual development of
tomorrow.
<!--l. 163--><p class="indent" >   Vygotski&#x012D; proposes further that ZPD is an essential feature of learning, which
distinguishes learning from development, but at the same time provokes
developmental processes that would not be possible without learning. In other
words,
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 165--><p class="noindent" >It awakens a variety of internal developmental processes that are
     able to operate only when the child is interacting with people
     in his environment and in cooperation with his peers (<a 
href="#Xvygotskiui1978mind">Vygotski&#x012D;
     et&#x00A0;al.</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xvygotskiui1978mind">1978</a>, p. 90).</div>
<!--l. 168--><p class="indent" >   By applying the ZPD to learning situations, the key takeaway is that the
analysis alters the traditional view of knowledge or mastery, and shows that the
constructed knowledge provides the basis for further development. A great
example of this is the process of mastering native language, which initially is
learned as a means of communication between the child and other people. The
use of language first happens on a social level, in the interaction with people, and
is later developed to internal speech and becomes a means to organize thought,
i.e., an internal mental function. Vygotski&#x012D; calls this concept the <span

<span

href="#Xvygotskiui1978mind">1978</a>).
<!--l. 170--><p class="indent" >   Another classic example is that of a child trying to grasp a ball. At first the
gesture means nothing to the child, but when the mother realizes that the
gesture indicates something, the situation changes dramatically. When she gives
him the ball, as a result of the hand gesture, the &#8221;...grasping movement changes
to the act of pointing&#8221; (<a 
href="#Xvygotskiui1978mind">Vygotski&#x012D; et&#x00A0;al.</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xvygotskiui1978mind">1978</a>, p. 56). This means that the
operation that was initially an external activity is now &#8221;...reconstructed and
begins to occur internally&#8221; (<a 
href="#Xvygotskiui1978mind">Vygotski&#x012D; et&#x00A0;al.</a>,&#x00A0;<a

precedes <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">internalization</span>.
<!--l. 172--><p class="indent" >   With this in mind, a teacher can understand what developmental processes is
maturing in their students, and from that give adapted challenges, show partial
solutions and in general tailor what to say and teach next. From this perspective,
                                                                     <img

development is lagging behind learning, and the challenge for the teacher
becomes to teach ahead of development, but at the same time not too far ahead.
This leads us to the concept of scaffolding, which can be argued to be a
refinement of ZPD.
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.2.6   </span> <a 
 id="x1-120001.2.6"></a>Scaffolding</h4>
<!--l. 175--><p class="noindent" >Vygotski&#x012D;&#8217;s zone of proximal development is the distance between what a person
can do alone and what he can do with help from a more knowledgeable other
(MKO). What types of help and how the MKO should provide it, has not been a
focal point for Vygotski&#x012D;. Although <a 
href="#Xwood1976role">Wood, Bruner and&#x00A0;Ross</a> does not
reference to any Vygotski&#x012D;an literature, the term scaffolding introduced by
them in 1976, bears resemblance to the very idea of ZPD. As they put
it:
<!--l. 177--><p class="indent" >
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 177--><p class="noindent" >Scaffolding consist essentially of the adult &#8221;controlling&#8221; those
     elements  of  the  task  that  are  initially  beyond  the  learner&#8217;s
     capacity, thus permitting him to concentrate upon and complete
     only  those  elements  that  are  within  his  range  of  competence
     (<a

<!--l. 180--><p class="indent" >   Thus, scaffolding can be applied by MKOs in order to keep the learning
process within the learner&#8217;s ZPD. There is a is a nuanced balance for how much
guiding is needed and a key point is that a person&#8217;s ZPD is personal, thus a
scaffold should be personally adjusted. An example can be if we were to teach
two persons how to take a picture with a professional DSLR camera, one
being an old woman (Mary) with little insight in technology, the other
a young man (Ryan) who has grown up with technology. It is obvious
that the two persons have different cultural backgrounds and taking a
picture have different meanings to them, hence the tutoring of them need
to be tailored differently. In the following section we will go through
the six steps of scaffolding provided by <a 
href="#Xwood1976role">Wood et&#x00A0;al.</a>&#x00A0;(<a

example.

     <li

class="cmti-10x-x-109">Recruitment </span>- We need to get the learners attention and interest in
     the task at hand. In our case this could be to show nice pictures of
     Mary&#8217;s grandchildren to make her interested in taking nice pictures of
     them herself. For Ryan we could show the difference between pictures
     taken with an iPhone and a DSLR camera to make him understand
     the value of using a DSLR versus his iPhone.

     in order to provide a clear goal that can be reached. For Mary we can
     say that her task is to take a photo of her grandson playing in the
     garden with the use of auto-mode. And for Ryan, the task could be
     to take a landscape photo of his favorite view for his Facebook cover
     photo with the camera setting called A for aperture, which lets him
     control the depth of field - an important setting when photographing
     landscapes.

     toward the goal, which implies a focus on motivation. Both to maintain
     progression and to keep a focus on the goal. From this point, scaffolding
     becomes  an  improvisation  skill  and  it  can  be  hard  to  plan  ahead
     because  of  all  the  unforeseen  things  that  can  happen.  Ryan  can
     for example stop focusing on the landscape photo and instead take
     pictures of a car. While Mary starts looking at the pictures contained
     on the camera&#8217;s memory stick. In this case one has to evaluate the
     goal versus the reduction in degrees of freedom. It might be that Ryan
     is more interested in taking pictures of cars, and since the main goal
     is to learn to take photos with a DSLR camera, an adjustment of
     the end product can be done. In Mary&#8217;s case however, she might be
     easily distracted, and just needs someone to tell her to focus on taking
     pictures of her grandson. These are nuances that can be hard to spot,
     and requires a tutor with good improvisation skills.

  class="enumerate" id="x1-12008x4"> <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">Marking critical features </span>- Marking what the learner has done versus
     what is expected. This could be to show Mary that in her picture, she
     has left half her grandson&#8217;s head out of the picture, and that she should
     try to capture a photo with the whole face visible. For Ryan it could be
     to point out that he has a very small depth of field in his photo, putting
     the trees in the foreground into focus, while leaving the mountains in
     the background blurred. Examples of correct solutions could be used to
     demonstrate the discrepancies between what the learner has produced
     and a correct solution.

  class="enumerate" id="x1-12010x5"> <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">Frustration control </span>- Balancing the dependency of the tutor and the
     independent problem solving. Both Mary and Ryan should be given
     some space to try taking photos, but we should at the same time be
     observant of when guiding or telling is needed. We could tell them to
     have the sun behind them to get the right light conditions, and hold
     the camera with two hands. The major risk here, is that the learner can
                                                                     <img

     become too dependent of the tutor, making it harder for the learner
     to achieve the goal, i.e., taking a picture alone at a later time.

     <li

     earlier attempts and possibly correcting errors, with a hope that the
     learner will imitate back in a more correct manner. For Mary we could
     take a picture of her grandson, imitating her position, look for the sun,
     and then correct the position to get the sun behind us. Or for Ryan we
     could place the camera on a chair and use a timer to reduce movement
     of the camera, thereby allowing a slower shutter speed. This would
     allow a higher aperture, increasing the depth of field, giving focus to
     both the trees in the foreground and the mountains in the background.
     This might be supplemented by telling, to provide a context to the
     tutor&#8217;s actions.</li></ol>
<!--l. 196--><p class="indent" >   As presented, some of these steps require planning while others require
improvisation. Both the planning and improvisation turns out to be tailored to
the specific situation at hand with all the complex contexts the learners bring

done on pre-school children. Critics may therefore argue that the concepts are
not applicable to adult learning. Our stance is that when learning new concepts,
both children and adults are alike. New and unknown concepts are new and
unknown both for adults and children, and adults therefore become &#8221;as
children&#8221; when introduced with new learning material. The concepts can
therefore be used to analyze learning in all contexts where learning takes
place.

<!--l. 203--><p class="noindent" >Multiple external representations (MER) are often used for conveying
information. Textbooks and manuals contain images and illustrations, maps show
different information in different ways, and whiteboards are used in addition to
speech. With digital technology the possibilities of MER are expanded to include
dynamic linking between the representations, and the representations can show
                                                                     <img

dynamic information that is not available in the real world, e.g., visualizing the
flow of oxygen.

     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-13002x1"> <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">Complementary roles </span>- Different representations can focus on different
     aspects of the phenomenon under study, or they can contain different
     information  of  the  same  phenomenon.  E.g.,  a  topographic  map  in
     addition to a road map.
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-13004x2"> <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">Constrain interpretation </span>- One representation can be used to constrain
     the interpretation of the other. E.g., the text &#8220;the fork lies next to
     the  spoon&#8221;.  It  is  impossible  to  tell  which  side  the  fork  is  on,  but
     by presenting an illustration of the example, the representation will
     constrain the interpretation of the text.
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-13006x3"> <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">Construct deeper understanding </span>- MER can be used to &#8221;...promote

href="#Xainsworth1999functions">Ainsworth</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xainsworth1999functions">1999</a>, p. 141).</li></ol>
<!--l. 212--><p class="indent" >   The three different roles presented above are also the benefits of using MER.
Complementary roles can support students to make up for insufficient knowledge
of one representation by using another, constrain interpretation can &#8220;support the
learners&#8217; reasoning about the less familiar representation&#8221; <a 
href="#Xainsworth1999functions">Ainsworth</a>&#x00A0;(<a

<!--l. 214--><p class="indent" >   On the other hand, when learners are faced with MER they must also
undertake additional tasks as to understand the phenomenon or domain in
question. This may lead to a heavy cognitive load, which &#8221;...may leave less
resources for actual learning&#8221; (<a

associated with MER, while keeping the benefits.

href="#Xprince2006inductive">Prince and&#x00A0;Felder</a>&#x00A0;(<a

in a <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">deductive </span>manner. In the same way as Sherlock Holmes collects
piece by piece to form a theory, the students collect pieces of models and
illustrations to grasp a scientific concept. Little attention is paid to why the
students should learn the material, apart from having to perform on
                                                                     <img

tests.
<!--l. 219--><p class="indent" >   On the other hand we have the <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">inductive </span>ways of teaching and learning.
Instead of beginning with the theory, the students are presented with some sort
of task, which becomes the motivation to learn the tools required to solve the
task. Examples of this can be to make a battery in a science class, or finding out
why potato-chips bags seem more inflated on the top of a mountain than by the
sea.
<!--l. 221--><p class="indent" >   Inquiry learning involves giving the students &#8221;...questions to be answered,
problems to be solved, or a set of observations to be explained&#8221; (<a

and&#x00A0;Felder</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xprince2006inductive">2006</a>, p. 127), or in other words: giving the students incentives to
ask for information. There are several other inductive learning methods, such as
problem-based learning, discovery learning and project-based learning, which all
can be explained with the same statements as inquiry learning. Inquiry learning
can therefore be seen as an umbrella term for inductive learning methods. (<a

Depending on the student&#8217;s developmental level, different framings of the inquiry
process are needed. To scaffold the inquiry learning process is not an easy task.
In a review article, <a 
href="#Xde1998scientific">De&#x00A0;Jong and&#x00A0;Van&#x00A0;Joolingen</a>&#x00A0;(<a

that learners may encounter when engaging with inquiry learning: <span

<span

class="cmti-10x-x-109">regulation of</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">discovery learning</span>. They continue to argue for the need of supporting students
during the process of scientific inquiry, providing scaffolds for each of
these problems. The challenge then becomes to &#8221;...guide students to the
&#8221;right&#8221; path, but at the same time letting them discover and make the
discovery their own&#8221; (<a 
href="#Xkluge2010simulation">Kluge and&#x00A0;Bakken</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xkluge2010simulation">2010</a>, p. 247). In other words the
students need to be steered toward the interesting discoveries, but at the
same time have the freedom to explore and not be commanded in any
way.

<a 
href="#Xgomez2008elementary">Gomez-Zwiep</a>&#x00A0;(<a

understanding of science that is often inconsistent with what the teacher
intended through his or her instruction&#8221;. These are often deeply rooted, and
remain intact even after instruction. This becomes especially relevant when
dealing with inductive learning methods, as the students are given more
freedom to explore their own ideas, and thus more freedom to pursue tracks
that may lead to different conclusions than the ones intended by the
instructor.

on the focus: &#8221;alternative frameworks&#8221;, &#8221;preconceptions&#8221;, and &#8221;student ideas&#8221;
are just some of them. An important factor here is how misconceptions are
perceived. Are they resources for learning, or obstacles that the learner has to
overcome? If we look at meaning making from a constructivist point of view,
advanced knowledge is built upon prior understanding. Misconceptions then
become &#8221;...faulty extensions of productive prior knowledge&#8221; (<a
