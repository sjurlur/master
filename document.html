<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >In this chapter, we will present the empirical setting and methods used in
this thesis. First we will describe the empirical setting in which the data
collection took place. Then we will proceed to present the methods for
gathering data with a description of the technicalities of the data. Lastly, we
will describe the analytical procedures and selection of data material to
present.
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.1   </span> <a 
 id="x1-20001.1"></a>Empirical setting</h3>
<!--l. 6--><p class="noindent" >The collection of data material used in this thesis took part in late autumn 2013,
at a high school located in the center of Oslo. The school has a high limit
for admission, with a lower requirement of 43.5 points out of 60 in 2010
(<a 
href="#Xutdanningsetaten">Utdanningsetaten</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xutdanningsetaten">2010</a>). Thus, the students at this school are mostly high
achievers.
<!--l. 8--><p class="indent" >   Contact with the school was first initiated through Intermedia, and a
presentational flier was sent as an explanation of the project (insert an appendix
ref here). A teacher contacted us, and luckily our request coincided perfectly with
a two-week time frame for reviewing photosynthesis in his biology class. He was
therefore willing to test out our application instead of performing one of the
experiments described in the textbook.
<!--l. 10--><p class="indent" >   The class selected was a biology class at the highest level offered at the school,
biology 2, which has an extensive curriculum covering e.g. photosynthesis,
enzymes and energy transmitters (<a 
href="#Xbios">Sletbakk et&#x00A0;al.</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xbios">2008</a>). The class consisted of
11 girls and three boys between 17 and 18 years of age. For the main part of
our data collection, all of these were present. All the students agreed to
participate in the study, but due to technical limitations and a busy time
schedule, the primary data collection was done with a small sample of the
group.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.1.1   </span> <a 
 id="x1-30001.1.1"></a>Ethics</h4>
<!--l. 13--><p class="noindent" >Prior to the data collection, an application was sent to NSD (Norwegian Social
Science Data Services) requesting permission to film the students. The application
was approved with only minor changes to how the material was to be treated after
completion. In addition all the students taking the class were given an agreement
form stating that participation was voluntary, and all material would be kept
anonymous (see appendix).
<!--l. 15--><p class="indent" >   Throughout this thesis, and in the transcript of video data, all the
students&#8217; names have been replaced by pseudonyms and the name of
                                                                          

                                                                          
the school is never mentioned. The data material containing identifying
information of the students has been and will be stored securely on a separate
hard drive at Intermedia, and will be deleted in upon termination of the
project.
<!--l. 17--><p class="indent" >   During our time at the school we were always open about our role as
researchers, and explained on several occasions how the data was going to be
used.

 id="x1-40001.1.2"></a>Planning the experiments</h4>
<!--l. 20--><p class="noindent" >An initial planning and presentational meeting was held on the 21st. of October
with the teacher. A thorough presentation and demonstration of the system was
given, along with a discussion of the functionalities of the system, to see if it
would spark some ideas for experiments.
<!--l. 22--><p class="indent" >   Stressing the importance of a scientific method, the teacher suggested that we
could conduct two experiments, using the different sensors in the system to
change one variable, while keeping the others relatively controlled. We agreed that
the factor which would be easiest to control, yet yield interesting results was light
intensity and light quality (wavelength). The first experiment would involve
keeping the plant located in a window facing west, receiving sunlight
and light from the fluorescent indoor-lighting, while we in the second
experiment would relocate the plant to a light proof cabinet where it would
only receive light of a known wavelength. Each of the two experiments
would span a one-week period, depending on the time needed for usable
results.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.1.3   </span> <a 
 id="x1-50001.1.3"></a>The experiments</h4>
<!--l. 25--><p class="noindent" >The project was presented for the class during a one-hour lecture on Friday 25th
of October. We used the opportunity to give an in-depth explanation and
demonstration of the physical plant, and the web-interface, as well as
explaining how we would collect and use the data material gathered. We then
proceeded to initiate the first experiment, which went on for seven days
until Friday 1st of November when the second experiment was initiated.
The second experiment went on for 13 days until Wednesday 13th of
November when the primary data collection session took place. During the
experiments we were present at four separate occasions, observing what
the teacher was focusing on, and the nature of the class discussions. In
                                                                          

                                                                          
addition we answered any questions they had regarding the system, and
observed how it was used by the teacher and how the students related to
it.

<!--l. 42--><p class="noindent" >The first experiment was conducted with a setup in the window as shown in
figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-5001r1">1.1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:windowplant --></a>. The system was located in the front of the classroom near a door
leading to the adjacent classroom, visible and in reach of everyone walking by. As
figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-5002r2">1.2<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:windowsystemplant --></a> shows, there is between 50 and 70 seeds in the pot. The plant was
located in the window sill, exposed to sunlight or daylight depending on
the weather, in addition to the fluorescent indoor-lighting. Due to the
time of year, and lack of people using the classroom in the evening, this
meant that the plant would get light in the period between 08:00 and
17:00.
<!--l. 44--><p class="indent" >   It turned out that the system was draining power from a power outlet that
was either connected to the light or timer based, as the system went down and did
not post data between 19:00 and 07:00. We also had some technical issues with
the system from 25th of October to 27th of October, resulting in lost data from
the first seeds germinating.

figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-6001r3">1.3<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:cabinetplant --></a>. The cabinet was located in a corner in the front of the classroom

in the window. The picture in figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-6001r3">1.3<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:cabinetplant --></a> is taken with flash and light
from the room coming in to the cabinet, hence it does not reflect the
lighting conditions in the cabinet during the experiment. The cabinet door
was closed and the lamp above the plant was emitting green light 24
hours a day, hence figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-6002r4">1.4<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:cabinetsystemplant --></a> shows the lighting conditions better. It is
also worth noting that the pot contains around 30-40 seeds more than in
the first experiment. When this experiment took place we did not have
any technical issues, the system posted data continuously for the whole
period.

 id="x1-80001.2"></a>Methods</h3>
<!--l. 65--><p class="noindent" >Different methods for data collection was discussed and reviewed early on in the
project. Our most influential source, regarding paradigm, methodology
and method was the tradition for using qualitative data in information
systems research in the design group at department of informatics. As our
primary data source we chose video data with the use of multiple cameras
and a screen dump. This was collected during a 45-minute session after
the completion of the experiments, resulting in 3x45 minutes of video
data and 45 minutes of audio data. Supplementary data from this session
includes the written answers from the groups that were not filmed, and
our personal notes. In the following sections the methods used will be
discussed.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.2.1   </span> <a 
 id="x1-90001.2.1"></a>Video and audio</h4>
<!--l. 68--><p class="noindent" >It was determined early in the project that video and audio recording were to be
used. The primary reason for this was the tradition at Intermedia, as video data
collection has been used and thoroughly tested by a number of researchers here.
This meant that we would get a lot of help from co-located researchers in what
                                                                          

                                                                          
microphones to use, placement of cameras, operation of the equipment,
etc.
<!--l. 70--><p class="indent" >   A total of 45 minutes of video and audio was recorded, using three separate
video sources, and three microphones. One camera was placed in front of the
group, able to capture facial expressions and where the students were looking.
This camera had an external microphone connected which we placed on the table
in front of the students, allowing us to filter out some of the noise in
the classroom. The second camera was placed behind the students on
their right hand side, facing the computer screen. This camera&#8217;s primary
function was to capture where the students were pointing and what they
were doing on the laptop. The audio source of the second camera was
the built-in microphone, which proved to cover most of the audio in the
classroom. In addition to the video cameras we recorded a screen capture
from the laptop, showing exactly what the students were doing in the
system. The laptop had a built-in microphone as well but we only used the
sound from camera two and the laptop to synchronize the different videos.

reason was to ensure that the system was working, assist with any technical
difficulties regarding the user interface, and to ensure a smooth operation of the
experiments. But we would also take notes regarding how the system was used in
the education, if or how students showed interest in the experiments, and how the
teacher was conveying information about photosynthesis in general. While
these observation sessions were not thoroughly planned, and the data
material never systematized, it proved to be a good supplementary data
source to help us structure and make sense of our primary data. We would
later on also use these notes as discussion points when reviewing the data
material.

      <!--l. 94--><p class="noindent" >An interdisciplinary method for the empirical investigation of the
      interaction of human beings with each other and with objects in
      their environment. It investigates human activities such as talk,
      nonverbal interaction, and the use of artifacts and technologies,
      identifying routine practices and problems and the resources for
      their solution (<a

<!--l. 100--><p class="indent" >   For Interaction analysis to become a reality video and audio recording
technology has been a vital resource. The combination of recording talk as well as
nonverbal interaction and the ability to replay a sequence as many times as
necessary gives us the possibility to analyze more thoroughly. Combining this
micro-level data of interaction with ethnographic data gives us a means of
analyzing how the interaction is part of the situated context and institutional
practices. (<a

href="#Xfurberg2009scientific">2009</a>). <span class="sout"> By observing the class during our visits to the
school during the experiments, and by reading the textbook chapter on
photosynthesis, we gathered ethnographic data on how the class worked
together and what they were expected to know about photosynthesis.

href="#Xderry2010conducting">Derry et&#x00A0;al.</a>&#x00A0;(<a 
href="#Xderry2010conducting">2010</a>) speaks about two different approaches to select parts of a
video corpus for further examination; the <span 
class="cmti-12">inductive </span>and the <span 
class="cmti-12">deductive </span>approach.
Inductive approaches apply when a minimally edited video corpus is collected and
investigated with broad questions in mind but without a strong orienting theory.
                                                                          

                                                                          
Deductive approaches involve identifying or creating a suitable video corpus and
systematically sampling from it to examine specific re-search questions. (<a 
href="#Xderry2010conducting">Derry
et&#x00A0;al.</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xderry2010conducting">2010</a>) To start with, we clearly fit into the inductive approach, but as
many researchers have experienced: once you find something, you start looking for
it. Hence our approach became leaned more to the deductive side later in our
analysis.
<!--l. 108--><p class="indent" >   To make sense of the data gathered we looked at it in several different ways
with different focuses. Below is a chronological list of the ways we approached the
data.

<!--l. 124--><p class="indent" >   While we still had the impressions from the data collection fresh in mind, we
sat down and watched all the video material. During the screening process we
tried to make a content-log to get a better overview of a large corpus of data and
select cue points in the video where interesting interaction took place, focusing on
change in context and contradictions. This was followed by a rough transcription,
using mostly audio and video from the camera facing the students. At this point
we focused mostly on transcribing what was said, not paying attention to small
audible details such as intonation.
<!--l. 126--><p class="indent" >   We then went on to the third step in the process, bringing in additional video
material to generate thick descriptions of the interesting interactions taking place.
Using audio cues, we merged all the three video files into one, so that the screen
was divided into three parts. One for the camera facing the students,
one for the camera facing the screen, and one for the screen dump. This
enabled us to make a more detailed transcript of the parts where inaudible
interaction took place or when the students pointed at something in the
system.
<!--l. 128--><p class="indent" >   At this point in the process we presented the transcript and screened the video
along with our supervisor, marking the points in the video which we deemed most
interesting. In the following discussion a list of themes or grouping categories was
selected which would be subject to further analysis. A selection of transcription
pieces was then picked out for further analysis where we kept focus on
intonation, gestures, etc. to provide a thorough description of the events
unfolding.
<!--l. 130--><p class="indent" >   As shown in the list, our approach was quite open to begin with, scanning the
complete video corpus for what we found interesting. Once we began to find parts
that interested us, we started to look for similar events and contradicting events.
With help from our supervisor we found theoretical concepts we could link to our
material, which again gave us an incentive to look for a specific type of
material.
<!--l. 132--><p class="indent" >   At point 8 in the list, we had found over 20 excerpts that we wanted to present
and discuss. By categorizing these into four themes: <span 
class="cmti-12">Hypothesis generation and</span>
<span 
class="cmti-12">testing</span>, <span 
class="cmti-12">Misconception</span>, <span 
class="cmti-12">Conceptualization </span>and <span 
class="cmti-12">Linking between representations</span>,
we were able to find the best excerpts to represent the themes. Hence
we ended up with 11 excerpts which will be presented in the following
chapter.
