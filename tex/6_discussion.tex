\chapter{Discussion}
In this chapter we will discuss our research question by contextualizing our findings to the analytical concepts introduced earlier . As an overall theme we will look at the inquiry process of the students in interaction with Monoplant. This will manifest through 4 sections, the first being about the inquiry process. Further we will discuss how multiple External representations support the inquiry process of the students, how Scaffolding is instatiated in the environment and how the institutional setting frame the students inquiry process.

\section{Inquiry process}
In this section we will broadly address our first research question: What characterizes the students’ inquiry in interaction with monoplant? 
In the previous chapter we presented excerpts from the session where the students interacted with monoplant. We have seen that the students were generating hypotheses of what happened with the plant and why it grew as much as it did. We showed examples of explanations, discussion, misconceptions and surprises. 
The experiments conducted and the session with the students can be categorized as \emph{guided inquiry} \citeauthor*{staver1987analysis} \citetext{\citeyear{staver1987analysis}, referenced in \citealp{prince2006inductive}}. The students are given a problem (the questions) but need to figure out answers by themselves (with the help of Monoplant). 

The four problems that \citep{de1998scientific} addressed for inquiry learning where: \textit{hypothesis generation}, \textit{design of experiments}, \textit{interpretation of data}, and \textit{regulation of discovery learning}. In our case it can be said that we controlled two of these problems by designing and initiating the experiments for the students, as well letting Monoplant do a systematic logging of data during the experiment, hence regulating the inquiry process. This meant that the students faced two problems, that of interpreting the data as well as generating hypotheses based on the data. \citeauthor*{klahr1993heuristics} \citetext{\citeyear{klahr1993heuristics}, referenced in \citealp{de1998scientific}} reported that misinterpretation of data often result in confirmation of current hypothesis. 

As we showed in excerpt 1, Siri had a hypothesis in which she stated that plant B would not grow much, because it would not get as much light as plant A. In excerpt 2 data was presented to her that showed that plant B had indeed grown much. It can be argued that her interpretation of this data and her new hypothesis in excerpt 3 was directed by her first hypothesis, since the data collided with her first hypothesis the next hypothesis is claiming there might be some error source in the experiment. Hence the misinterpretation did not result in a direct confirmation of the previous hypothesis, instead it lay the basis for a denial of a disconfirmation, or an explanation for why the first hypothesis did not hold.

As the students were done with the textbook chapter of photosynthesis and had connected theoretical explanations to phenomenas such as growth, it can be said that the presumptions of the outcomes to the experiment colored the interpretation of data. Siri knew that plants makes food for themselves by doing photosynthesis. To do photosynthesis, a green plant such as the cress in the experiment need light of wavelengths other than green (blue and red). This reasoning is enabled in Siri because she know a lot of the scientific concepts concerning the theme at hand. We can almost say that the inquiry process became deductive as it was affected by the students preconceptions. This relates to misconceptions in inquiry learning, and what \citep{gomez2008elementary} refers to as inconsistent understanding according to what the teacher intended. In this case Siris conception of photosynthesis, which in the context of the textbook examples makes sense, becomes a misconception when she is confronted with a plant that germinates, hence leads her to erroneous conclusions. As mentioned earlier \citet{smith1994misconceptions} makes the description of this kind of misconceptions as "faulty extentions of productive prior knowledge". A conception might describe a phenomena in one context, and falsely describe it in another context. A similar statement to that of \citeauthor{klahr1993heuristics}: 

\begin{quote}"compared to the binary feedback provided to subjects in the typical psychology experiment, real-world evidence evaluation is not so straightforward" \citetext{\citet[p. 114]{klahr1993heuristics}, referenced in \citealp{de1998scientific}}
\end{quote}

We have now established that the inquiry process is influenced by the fact that the students have a certain knowledge about the phenomena at hand. This can at one side lead to misconceptions, since the students have a greater freedom to pursue ideas that can lead to different conclusions than intended by the instructor. Therefore it becomes important to guide the students on the right tracks as we will discuss later in the section about scaffolding.

The students tend to talk with an everyday language, explaining what they see when looking at videos and images in the system. Even though the inquiry process is affected by their presumptions and knowledge about photosynthesis, they merely speak in scientific terms when explaining what they see. 



\section{Multiple External Representations in Inquiry processes}
How does Monoplant, by visualizing/present photosynthesis differently from the text book, support the inquiry process? 
Here we can talk about: 
\begin{itemize}
\item{how do the textbook represent photosynthesis/external factors}
\item{how do Monoplant represent photosynthesis/external factors}
\item{\nameref{ex:excerpt10} (soilmoist)}
\item{\nameref{ex:excerpt6} (misconception from textbook representation)}
\item{Excerpts: 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10}
\item{MER}
\item{Social practices}
\item{Everyday language \& Scientific language}
\end{itemize}




\section{Scaffolding}
How is scaffolding instantiated in the environment?
Here we can talk about: 
\begin{itemize}
\item{ZPD}
\item{Scaffolding}
\item{Inquiry learning}
\item{Misconceptions}
\item{Excerpts: (3), 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
\end{itemize}



\section{Institutional setting}
How does the institutional setting frame the students inquiry process? (“doing school \& doing science”)
Here we can talk about: 
\begin{itemize}
\item{Institutional settings}
