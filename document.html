<!--l. 4--><p class="noindent" >In this chapter we will lay forth the theoretical perspective and theoretical
concepts we will apply in this thesis. First we will introduce the <span 
class="cmti-12">sociocultural</span>
<span 
class="cmti-12">perspective </span>and highlight some key points including <span 
class="cmti-12">institutional practices</span>, <span 
class="cmti-12">zone of</span>
<span 
class="cmti-12">proximal development </span>and <span

<span

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.1   </span> <a 
 id="x1-30001.1"></a>Sociocultural perspective</h3>
<!--l. 13--><p class="noindent" >In a biological sense the human species has not evolved significantly the last ten
thousand years or so. In fact, changes in our gene pool are only minor, and can&#8217;t
explain the difference between modern people and people of the Stone Age. Still
we are able to achieve tasks that would have been impossible for our ancestors
(<span 
class="cmbx-12">?</span>).
<!--l. 15--><p class="indent" >   The explanation of this discrepancy from a sociocultural perspective
becomes evident when one takes into account the <span 
class="cmti-12">tools </span>and <span 
class="cmti-12">signs </span>we use to
mediate the world. We have created a culture where each of the <span 
class="cmti-12">tools </span>and
<span 
class="cmti-12">signs </span>we use has a long history embedded in them. For instance if you are
given the multiplication problem 122<span 
class="tcrm-1200">&#x00D7;</span>284, you can flip up a calculator
and get the answer instantaneously. Similarly, if you were to solve the
multiplication problem 7<span 
class="tcrm-1200">&#x00D7;</span>4 you can look up in a multiplication table and
find the answer easily. These <span 
class="cmti-12">cultural tools </span>(calculator and multiplication
table) enable you to make sense of the world in a different way than our
ancestors.
<!--l. 17--><p class="indent" >   From the example given above we can see that there is an &#8220;irreducible
tension&#8221; between the agent and the cultural tool (<span 
class="cmbx-12">?</span>). Without the multiplication
table you would not be able to solve the problem. But the multiplication table is
not enough, as it would have been useless without a skilled user. The goal of a
sociocultural approach is therefore to:
<!--l. 19--><p class="indent" >
      <div class="quote">
      <!--l. 20--><p class="noindent" >&#8221;Create an account of human mental processes that recognizes the
      essential relationship between these processes and their cultural,
      historical, and institutional setting.&#8221;(<span 
class="cmbx-12">?</span>)</div>
<!--l. 23--><p class="indent" >   This means that the unit of analysis is human action, and how it is mediated
by cultural tools, or &#8220;agent-acting-with-mediational-means&#8221; (<span 
class="cmbx-12">? </span>cited in&#x00A0;<span 
class="cmbx-12">?</span>). The
mediated action can never be understood by the properties of only the agent, the
mediational means, or the cultural, historical and institutional setting of the
                                                                          

                                                                          
mediated activity. An example of this is H<sub><span 
class="cmr-8">2</span></sub>O: one can not understand
what makes up water if one analyses hydrogen and oxygen separately.
The characteristic of the whole is not made up by the characteristics of
the elements (<span 
class="cmbx-12">?</span>). Another example is the track-and-field event of pole
vaulting.
      <div class="quote">
      <!--l. 25--><p class="noindent" >&#8221;The pole by itself does not magically propel vaulters over a cross
      bar; it must be used skillfully by the agent. At the same time, an
      agent without a pole or with an inappropriate pole is incapable
      of participating in the event&#8221; (<span 
class="cmbx-12">?</span>).</div>
<!--l. 27--><p class="noindent" >So while analysis of the elements in isolation may be informative, we will never
understand the big picture without taking into account the relation between the
mediational means, the agent, and the sociocultural context.
<!--l. 29--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.1.1   </span> <a 
 id="x1-40001.1.1"></a>Tools &amp; Signs</h4>
<!--l. 30--><p class="noindent" >One important distinction to make when talking about mediated activity is that
of tools (physical tools) and signs (psychological tools) (<span 
class="cmbx-12">?</span>). While they are similar
in that they can play a mediating role in activity, they are different in the ways
they orient human behavior. The tool is externally oriented and must lead to
change in physical objects. A basic example of a tool is a hammer. An agent can
mediate her activity toward the external world by using the tool to crush a
coconut. A sign on the other hand is internally oriented and &#8220;changes
nothing in the object of psychological operation&#8221; (<span 
class="cmbx-12">?</span>). Examples of signs
are: diagrams, drawings, language, or as mentioned above, multiplication
tables. &#8220;It is a means of internal activity aimed at mastering oneself&#8221;
(<span 
class="cmbx-12">?</span>).
<!--l. 32--><p class="indent" >   Another illuminating example of the difference between tools and signs is that
of a child presented with a birthday cake. The child does not immediately start
eating, but waits until &#8220;happy birthday&#8221; has been sung and she has blown out
the candles. In that sense the cake is a sign as it represents a lot more
than just food in the mind of the child. It signifies that she is a year
older, that she is going to get presents afterwards, that she is celebrated,
etc. On the other hand, from the parents&#8217; point of view, the cake can be
used to signify that she is a year older and has new responsibilities in the
society.
                                                                          

                                                                          
<!--l. 34--><p class="indent" >   If we look at the same example from a behavioristic point of view, another
situation emerge. The behavioristic model focuses on the role of the individual
and the notion that knowledge arises through individual drill and practice. The
girl would therefore know from previous experience that cake tastes good, and
immediately start to dig in.
<!--l. 36--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="cmti-12">In contrast</span>, the cognitive model focuses on thought processes and the notion
that the environment provides raw material for testing innately conceived
hypotheses. The reason for the girl not eating the cake would therefore be an
internal thought process and the context in which the cake is placed would play a
minor role.
<!--l. 38--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.1.2   </span> <a 
 id="x1-50001.1.2"></a>Implications for Learning</h4>
<!--l. 39--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;From a sociocultural perspective learning is understood as mastery and
appropriation of cultural tools&#8221; (Wertsch, 1998, Säljö, 1999, 2001, cited in <span 
class="cmbx-12">?</span>). <span 
class="cmbx-12">?</span>
does however make a distinction between knowing how to use a cultural tool
(mastery) and making a cultural tool one&#8217;s own (appropriation). Appropriation
can be to take the mastery one step further. Oxford dictionary defines it as &#8220;the
action of taking something for one&#8217;s own use&#8221;, or as <span 
class="cmbx-12">? </span>puts it &#8220;making a cultural
tool one&#8217;s own&#8221;. One example of this is a person who has mastered the cultural
tool &#8221;chords&#8221; on a guitar and later appropriates them to a song. It should
however be recognized that both mastery and appropriation does not always
happen. For example, a person could master the chords on the guitar and perform
them flawlessly in class, but dismiss them as terribly ugly at home. Likewise, a
person can appropriate chords to a song without mastering the chords
themselves.
<!--l. 41--><p class="indent" >   When we then ask what learning is from a sociocultural perspective, we are
also asking &#8220;&#8216;which cultural tools are valued?&#8217;, and &#8216;In which contexts do they
apply&#8217;&#8221; (<span 
class="cmbx-12">?</span>). In order to give an answer to these questions, we have to take into
account the cultural, historical and institutional context of the mediated
activity.
<!--l. 43--><p class="indent" >   To set the scope for our thesis we have decided to place an emphasis on the
institutional part of the context, while still acknowledging that the context has
cultural and historical aspects.
<!--l. 45--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.1.3   </span> <a 
 id="x1-60001.1.3"></a>Social practices</h4>
<!--l. 46--><p class="noindent" >With a sociocultural perspective on learning, we see external and internal
                                                                          

                                                                          
processes as intertwined. By this we try to see student interactions with artefacts
and each other as embedded in a cultural, historical and institutional practice,
meaning that we take into account the relation between the mediational means,
the agent and her contexts. These practices can be embedded into cultural
artefacts or as <span 
class="cmbx-12">? </span>states: &#8221;computer based environments can embed such practices
in the design&#8221;. She mentions two types of social practices embedded in Web-based
inquiry learning environments: <span 
class="cmti-12">scientific inquiry </span>and <span 
class="cmti-12">institutional practices</span>.
Scientific inquiry is often expressed by encouraging students to do ideal scientific
activities e.g. hypothesis generation, evaluating evidence and constructing
explanations. Institutional practices can be expressed in terms of school science as
an institutional practice, for example by means of tools that enable the teacher to
supervise the students, assignments that makes the students think as
if they are beeing assessed, or tools for the students to test their own
skills. These practices can also include metaphores taken directly from the
institution of school, for example as shown in figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-6001r1">1.1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:scrshotviten --></a> where all the
assignments states that you need to be logged in as a student to type in an
answer. These &#8221;embedded institutional practices can be, and often are,
at odds with the ideal practices of scientific inquiry.&#8221; (<span

&#8220;construction, representation, evaluation of knowledge claims and investigative

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.1.4   </span> <a 
 id="x1-70001.1.4"></a>Zone of Proximal Development</h4>
<!--l. 58--><p class="noindent" >One of the originators of the sociocultural perspective, Lev Vygotski&#x012D;, was
concerned with the relationship between learning and development, and argues
that the theorists of his time such as Piaget, James and Koffka does not provide
an adequate view of this. He finds that learning and development are
interrelated, and that this relationship has some specific applications
in school-learning. (<span 
class="cmbx-12">?</span>, p. 84) Thus, in order to describe these issues he
introduces the concept Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), and defines it as
follows:
<!--l. 60--><p class="indent" >
      <div class="quote">
      <!--l. 60--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;The  distance  between  the  actual  developmental  level  as
      determined  by  independent  problem  solving  and  the  level  of
      &#8221;potential development&#8221; as determined through problem solving
      under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers&#8221;
      (<span 
class="cmbx-12">?</span>, p. 86)</div>
<!--l. 63--><p class="indent" >   The actual developmental level is in other words determined by looking at
what a person can do alone. Vygotski&#x012D; found that this traditional way of
determining a person&#8217;s mental development did not hold in school learning, as it
only describes what functions in a person that have already been matured. He
therefore introduces a new developmental level, the &#8221;potential development&#8221;,
which can describe the functions in a person that are in the process of maturation.
The actual development of a person is therefore the end product of developing,
                                                                          

                                                                          
while the potential development is the state and process of developing.
The ZPD can be used as a tool by teachers and instructors to delineate
the immediate future of their students, i.e., their actual development of
tomorrow.
<!--l. 65--><p class="indent" >   Vygotski&#x012D; proposes further that ZPD is an essential feature of learning, which
distinguishes learning from development, but at the same time provokes
developmental processes that would not be possible without learning. In other
words,
<!--l. 67--><p class="indent" >
      <div class="quote">
      <!--l. 67--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;It awakens a variety of internal developmental processes that are
      able to operate only when the child is interacting with people in
      his environment and in cooperation with his peers.&#8221; (<span 
class="cmbx-12">?</span>, p. 90)</div>
<!--l. 70--><p class="indent" >   By applying the ZPD to learning-situations, the key takeaway is that the
analysis alters the traditional view of knowledge or mastery, and shows that the
constructed knowledge provides the basis for further development. A great
example of this is the process of mastering native language, which initially is
learned as a means of communication between the child and other people. The use
of language first happens on a social level, in the interaction with people, and is
later developed to internal speech and becomes a means to organize thought, i.e.,
an internal mental function . Vygotski&#x012D; calls this concept the <span 
class="cmti-12">duality of learning</span>
(<span 
class="cmbx-12">?</span>).
<!--l. 72--><p class="indent" >   Another classic example is that of a child trying to grasp a ball. At first the
gesture means nothing to the child, but when the mother realizes that the gesture
indicates something, the situation changes dramatically. When she gives him the
ball, as a result of the hand gesture, the &#8221;grasping movement changes to the act of
pointing&#8221; (<span 
class="cmbx-12">?</span>). This means that the operation that was initially an external
activity is now &#8221;reconstructed and begins to occur internally&#8221; (<span 
class="cmbx-12">?</span>). Thus,
<span 
class="cmti-12">externalization </span>precedes <span 
class="cmti-12">internalization</span>.
<!--l. 74--><p class="indent" >   With this in mind, a teacher can understand what developmental processes is
maturing in their students, and from that give adapted challenges, show partial
solutions and in general tailor what to say and teach next. From this perspective,
development is lagging behind learning, and the challenge for the teacher becomes
to teach ahead of development, but at the same time not too far ahead. This leads
us to the concept of scaffolding, which can be argued to be a refinement of ZPD.
But first, let us take a look at how concepts are developed in the mind of the
learner.
                                                                          

                                                                          
<!--l. 76--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.1.5   </span> <a 
 id="x1-80001.1.5"></a>Spontaneous and scientific concepts</h4>
<!--l. 77--><p class="noindent" >In the early stages of life, children learn for the most part by experience. Skills
such as mastering the native language, walking, running are learned through trial
and error. This means that the knowledge of a concept is linked to the concrete
experience where she was presented with the concept. A child who is presented
with the concept of &#8221;brother&#8221; by a pointing gesture towards her brother, will at
first only associate the word &#8221;brother&#8221; with that specific person. This is what
Vygotsky calls <span 
class="cmti-12">spontaneous concepts</span>
<!--l. 79--><p class="indent" >   An only child on the other hand, will be introduced to the concept of brother
through other concepts. A parent can for instance say that &#8221;brothers are boys
who have the same parents&#8221;. The concept of brother will then be a general
concept for the child, not linked to any concrete experiences, but to the
concept of boys, same, and parents. This is what Vygotsky calls <span 
class="cmti-12">scientific</span>
<span 
class="cmti-12">concepts</span>
<!--l. 81--><p class="indent" >   The major difference between these two types of concepts is that spontaneous
concepts are developed outside the system of concepts and only linked to concrete
experiences in the mind of the learner. If we presented the child having a brother
with the abstract problem of a &#8221;brother&#8217;s brother&#8221; (<a 
href="#Xvygotsky2012thought">Vygotsky</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xvygotsky2012thought">2012</a>) he would
become confused, as his only knowledge of the concept of brother is with
situations with his brother
<!--l. 83--><p class="indent" >   In contrast, scientific concepts are developed within a system. They are
immediately given a place within the system of concepts, i.e explained by their
relation to other concepts. As a result, the child is consciously aware and able to
reflect on the concept (<span 
class="cmbx-12">?</span>). If we presented the only child with the abstract
problem of a &#8221;brother&#8217;s brother&#8221;, he would most likely be able to solve it
because of the concepts relation to other concepts in the mind of the
child.
<!--l. 85--><p class="indent" >   Another example is how children develop concept of time. In the early stages
of life, a child may think that day and night is analogous to light and darkness.
This is the spontaneous concept saturated by experience. It is only later in school
he learns the scientific concepts of the earth&#8217;s rotation and its relation to
the sun and the moon, which marks days and years. This information
has not been appropriated by experience, as the child has not been to
space, but rather constructed using different signs linked together by the
instructor.
<!--l. 87--><p class="indent" >   The relationship between these two categories is in <a 
href="#Xvygotsky2012thought">Vygotsky</a>&#x00A0;(<a 
href="#Xvygotsky2012thought">2012</a>)
explained as an upside-down pyramid. On the top we have the scientific
concepts, which are general and abstract. And on the bottom we have the
spontaneous concepts, which are specific and concrete. The concepts then move
towards each other. The scientific concepts move downwards &#8221;toward greater
                                                                          

                                                                          
concreteness&#8221; in a deductive manner, while the spontaneous concepts move
&#8221;upward toward greater abstractness&#8221; (<a 
href="#Xvygotsky2012thought">Vygotsky</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xvygotsky2012thought">2012</a>) in a inductive
manner.
<!--l. 89--><p class="indent" >   Even though the concepts move in opposite directions, there is a mutual
dependency between them. In more precise terms: &#8221;In working its slow way
upwards, an everyday concept clears a path for a scientific concept and its
downward development&#8221;. This means that &#8221;the development of a spontaneous
concept must have reached a certain level for the child to be able to absorb a
related scientific concept&#8221; (<a 
href="#Xvygotsky2012thought">Vygotsky</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xvygotsky2012thought">2012</a>). Vygotski&#x012D; relates this to the
Zone of Proximal Development, as the spontaneous concepts which lack
consciousness and control, &#8221;find this control in the zone of proximal development&#8221;
(<a 
href="#Xvygotsky2012thought">Vygotsky</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xvygotsky2012thought">2012</a>).
<!--l. 91--><p class="indent" >   It is therefore essential for the teacher to bring the spontaneous concepts up to
a level that makes the scientific concept within reach for the student. By doing
this, the student will have the experience, and the related concepts necessary for
constructing knowledge of an abstract concept.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.1.6   </span> <a 
 id="x1-90001.1.6"></a>Scaffolding</h4>
<!--l. 94--><p class="noindent" >Vygotski&#x012D;&#8217;s Zone of Proximal Development is the distance between what a person
can do alone and what he can do with help from a More Knowledgeable Other
(MKO). What types of help and how the MKO should provide it, has not been a
focal point for Vygotski&#x012D;. Although <span 
class="cmbx-12">? </span>does not reference to any Vygotski&#x012D;an
literature, the term scaffolding introduced by them in 1976, bears resemblance to
the very idea of ZPD. As they put it:
<!--l. 96--><p class="indent" >
      <div class="quote">
      <!--l. 96--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Scaffolding  consist  essentially  of  the  adult  &#8216;controlling&#8217;  those
      elements  of  the  task  that  are  initially  beyond  the  learner&#8217;s
      capacity, thus permitting him to concentrate upon and complete
      only those elements that are within his range of competence&#8221; (<span 
class="cmbx-12">?</span>)</div>
<!--l. 99--><p class="indent" >   Thus, scaffolding can be applied by MKOs in order to keep the learning
process within the learner&#8217;s ZPD. There is a is a nuanced balance for how much
guiding is needed and a key point is that a person&#8217;s ZPD is personal, thus a
scaffold should be personally adjusted. An example can be if we were to teach two
persons how to take a picture with a professional DSLR camera, one being an old
woman (Mary) with little insight in technology, the other a young man (Ryan)
                                                                          

                                                                          
who has grown up with technology. It is obvious that the two persons have
different cultural backgrounds and taking a picture have different meanings to
them, hence the tutoring of them need to be differently tailored. In the following
section we will go through the six steps of scaffolding provided by <span 
class="cmbx-12">? </span>using this
example.
<!--l. 101--><p class="indent" >
      <ol  class="enumerate1" >
      <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-9002x1"> <span 
class="cmti-12">Recruitment </span>- We need to get the learners attention and interest in the
      task at hand. In our case this could be to show nice pictures of Mary&#8217;s
      grandchildren to make her interested in taking nice pictures of them
      herself. For Ryan we could show the difference between pictures taken
      with an iPhone and a DSLR camera to make him understand the value
      of using a DSLR versus his iPhone.
      </li>
      <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-9004x2"> <span 
class="cmti-12">Reduction in degrees of freedom </span>- The task must be narrowed down in
      order to provide a clear goal that can be reached. For Mary we can say
      that her task is to take a photo of her grandson playing in the garden
      with the use of auto-mode. And for Ryan, the task could be to take a
      landscape photo of his favorite view for his Facebook cover photo with
      the camera setting called A for aperture, which lets him control the
      depth of field - an important setting when photographing landscapes.
      </li>
      <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-9006x3"> <span 
class="cmti-12">Direction  maintenance  </span>-  The  learners  must  be  kept  on  the  path
      towards the goal, which implies a focus on motivation. Both to maintain
      progression and to keep a focus on the goal. From this point, scaffolding
      becomes an improvisation skill and it can be hard to plan ahead because
      of all the unforeseen things that can happen. Ryan can for example
      stop  focusing  on  the  landscape  photo  and  instead  take  pictures  of
      a  car.  While  Mary  starts  looking  at  the  pictures  contained  on  the
      camera&#8217;s memory stick. In this case one has to evaluate the goal versus
      the reduction in degrees of freedom. It might be that Ryan is more
      interested in taking pictures of cars, and since the main goal is to learn
      to take photos with a DSLR camera, an adjustment of the end product
      can be done. In Mary&#8217;s case however, she might be easily distracted,
      and just needs someone to tell her to focus on taking pictures of her
      grandson. These are nuances that can be hard to spot, and requires a
      tutor with good improvisation skills.
      </li>
                                                                          

                                                                          
      <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-9008x4"> <span 
class="cmti-12">Marking critical features </span>- Marking what the learner has done versus
      what is expected. This could be to show Mary that in her picture, she
      has left half her grandson&#8217;s head out of the picture, and that she should
      try to capture a photo with the whole face visible. For Ryan it could be
      to point out that he has a very small depth of field in his photo, putting
      the trees in the foreground into focus, while leaving the mountains in
      the background blurred. Examples of correct solutions could be used to
      demonstrate the discrepancies between what the learner has produced
      and a correct solution.
      </li>
      <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-9010x5"> <span 
class="cmti-12">Frustration control </span>- Balancing the dependency of the tutor and the
      independent problem solving. Both Mary and Ryan should be given
      some space to try taking photos, but we should at the same time be
      observant of when guiding or telling is needed. We could tell them to
      have the sun behind them to get the right light conditions, and hold
      the camera with two hands. The major risk here, is that the learner can
      become too dependent of the tutor, making it harder for the learner to
      achieve the goal, i.e. taking a picture alone at a later time.
      </li>
      <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-9012x6"> <span 
class="cmti-12">Demonstration </span>- Showing a solution to the task, imitating the learner&#8217;s
      earlier attempts and possibly correcting errors, with a hope that the
      learner will imitate back in a more correct manner. For Mary we could
      take a picture of her grandson, imitating her position, look for the sun,
      and then correct the position to get the sun behind us. Or for Ryan we
      could place the camera on a chair and use a timer to reduce movement
      in the camera, thereby allowing a slower shutter speed, which again
      allows a higher aperture, increasing the depth of field, giving focus to
      both the trees in the foreground and the mountains in the background.
      This might be supplemented by telling, to provide a context to the
      tutor&#8217;s actions.</li></ol>
<!--l. 115--><p class="indent" >   As presented, some of these steps require planning while others require
improvisation. Both the planning and improvisation turns out to be tailored to
the specific situation at hand with all the complex contexts the learners bring
with them to the situation. The steps can either be carried out manually by a
tutor, or be mediated automatically by a computer-based system. <span 
class="cmbx-12">? </span>presents one
implementation of a computer-mediated scaffold where a critiquing system gives
the user a &#8221;reasoned opinion about a product or action generated by a human&#8221;.
Another example is from <span 
class="cmbx-12">? </span>where prompts requiring user-input is used to promote
student reflection.
                                                                          

                                                                          
<!--l. 117--><p class="indent" >   One important thing to note when reviewing the literature on scaffolding by <span 
class="cmbx-12">?</span>
and zpd by <span 
class="cmbx-12">? </span>is that these studies are done on pre-school children. Critics may
therefore argue that the concepts are not applicable to adult learning. Our stance
is that when learning new concepts, both children and adults are alike. New and
unknown concepts are new and unknown both for adults and children, and adults
therefore become &#8221;as children&#8221; when introduced with new learning material. The
concepts can therefore be used to analyse learning in all contexts where learning
takes place.

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.2   </span> <a 
 id="x1-100001.2"></a>Multiple External Representations</h3>
<!--l. 122--><p class="noindent" >Multiple external representations (MER) have been used since long before the
advent of computers for conveying information. Textbooks and manuals
often contain images and illustrations, maps show different information in
different ways, and whiteboards are used in addition to speech. With digital
technology the possibilities of MER are expanded to include dynamic linking
between the representations, and the representations can show dynamic
information that is not available in the real world, e.g., showing the flow of
oxygen.
<!--l. 124--><p class="indent" >   In an effort to identify the features of MER, <a 
href="#Xainsworth1999functions">Ainsworth</a>&#x00A0;(<a 
href="#Xainsworth1999functions">1999</a>) has developed a
classification framework. She suggests that MER can serve primarily three
different purposes in learning situations:
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize"> <span 
class="cmti-12">Complementary roles </span>- Different representations can focus on different
      aspects of the phenomenon under study, or they can contain different
      information  of  the  same  phenomenon.  E.g.  a  topographic  map  in
      addition to a road map.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize"> <span 
class="cmti-12">Constrain interpretation </span>- One representation can be used to constrain
      the interpretation of the other. E.g. the text &#8220;the fork lies next to
      the  spoon&#8221;.  It  is  impossible  to  tell  which  side  the  fork  is  on,  but
      by presenting an illustration of the example, the representation will
      constrain the interpretation of the text.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">  <span 
class="cmti-12">Construct  deeper  understanding  </span>-  MER  can  be  used  to  &#8220;promote
      abstraction,  to  encourage  generalization  and  to  teach  the  relation
      between representations&#8221; (<a 
href="#Xainsworth1999functions">Ainsworth</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xainsworth1999functions">1999</a>).</li></ul>
                                                                          

                                                                          
<!--l. 131--><p class="indent" >   The three different roles presented above are also the benefits of using MER.
Complementary roles can support students to make up for insufficient knowledge
of one representation by using another, constrain interpretation can &#8220;support the
learners&#8217; reasoning about the less familiar representation&#8221; <a 
href="#Xainsworth1999functions">Ainsworth</a>&#x00A0;(<a 
href="#Xainsworth1999functions">1999</a>), and
finally the learners can gain deeper understanding of the domain by translating
between representations (<a 
href="#Xvan2006supporting">van&#x00A0;der Meij and&#x00A0;de&#x00A0;Jong</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xvan2006supporting">2006</a>).
<!--l. 133--><p class="indent" >   On the other hand, when learners are faced with MER they must also
undertake additional tasks as to understand the phenomenon or domain in
question. This may lead to a heavy cognitive load, which &#8220;may leave less
resources for actual learning&#8221; (Sweller, 1988, 1989, referenced in <a

and&#x00A0;de&#x00A0;Jong</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xvan2006supporting">2006</a>). A key issue is then to reduce the cost for learners associated
with MER, while keeping the benefits.

href="#Xprince2006inductive">Prince and&#x00A0;Felder</a>&#x00A0;(<a 
href="#Xprince2006inductive">2006</a>) science has traditionally been
taught in a <span 
class="cmti-12">deductive </span>manner. In the same way as Sherlock Holmes collects
piece by piece to form a theory, the students collect pieces of models and
illustrations to grasp a scientific concept. Little attention is paid to why
the students should learn the material, apart from having to perform on
tests.
<!--l. 138--><p class="indent" >   On the other hand we have the <span 
class="cmti-12">inductive </span>ways of teaching and learning.
Instead of beginning with the theory, the students are presented with some sort of
task, which becomes the motivation to learn the tools required to solve the task.
Examples of this can be to make a battery in a science class, or finding out why
potato-chips bags seem more inflated on the top of a mountain than by the
sea.
<!--l. 140--><p class="indent" >   Inquiry learning involves giving the students &#8221;questions to be answered,
problems to be solved, or a set of observations to be explained&#8221; (<a 
href="#Xprince2006inductive">Prince
and&#x00A0;Felder</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xprince2006inductive">2006</a>), or in other words: giving the students incentives to ask for
information. There are several other inductive learning methods, such as
problem-based learning, discovery learning and project-based learning, which all
can be explained with the same statements as inquiry learning. Inquiry learning
can therefore be seen as an umbrella term for inductive learning methods. (<a

relates to the ZPD and scaffolding. Depending on the student&#8217;s developmental
level, different framings of the inquiry process are needed. To scaffold the

and&#x00A0;Van&#x00A0;Joolingen</a>&#x00A0;(<a

when engaging with inquiry learning: <span

class="cmti-12">design of experiments</span>,
<span 
class="cmti-12">interpretation of data</span>, and <span 
class="cmti-12">regulation of discovery learning</span>. They continue to
argue for the need of supporting students during the process of scientific inquiry,
providing scaffolds for each of these problems. The challenge then becomes
&#8221;guiding students to the &#8220;right&#8221; path, but at the same time letting them
discover and make the discovery their own.&#8221; (<span 
class="cmbx-12">?</span>, p. 247). In other words the
students need to be steered towards the interesting discoveries, but at the
same time have the freedom to explore and not be commanded in any
way.

<!--l. 146--><p class="noindent" >Misconceptions appear in most educational contexts. According to
<a 
href="#Xgomez2008elementary">Gomez-Zwiep</a>&#x00A0;(<a 
href="#Xgomez2008elementary">2008</a>) students have &#8221;qualitative differences in his or her
understanding of science that is often inconsistent with what the teacher
intended through his or her instruction&#8221;. These are often deeply rooted, and
remain intact even after instruction. This becomes especially relevant when
dealing with inductive learning methods, as the students are given more
freedom to explore their own ideas, and thus more freedom to pursue
tracks that may lead to different conclusions than the ones intended by the
instructor.
<!--l. 148--><p class="indent" >   The term itself has been given many labels in research literature, depending on
the focus: &#8221;alternative frameworks&#8221;, &#8221;preconceptions&#8221;, and &#8221;student ideas&#8221; are
just some of them. An important factor here is how misconceptions are
perceived. Are they resources for learning, or obstacles that the learner has to
overcome? If we look at meaning making from a constructivist point of view,
advanced knowledge is built upon prior understanding. Misconceptions then
become &#8221;faulty extensions of productive prior knowledge&#8221; (<a

href="#Xsmith1994misconceptions">1994</a>), a too narrow view in their role in learning. If we take
the example of stating that &#8221;multiplication makes numbers larger&#8221;, it is
indeed an accurate explanation of most multiplication pieces. The problem
arises in the few cases where we multiply by non-natural numbers. The
conception that leads to erroneous conclusions in some contexts can be quite

characterizes the students&#8217; inquiry in interaction with monoplant? In the previous

controlled two of these problems by designing and initiating the experiments for
the students, as well as letting Monoplant do a systematic logging of data during
the experiment, hence regulating the inquiry process. This meant that the
students faced two problems, that of interpreting the data and generating
hypotheses based on the data. <a

result in confirmation of current hypothesis.
<!--l. 14--><p class="indent" >   As showed in excerpt 1, Siri presented a hypothesis in which she stated that
                                                                          

                                                                          
plant B would not grow much because it would not get as much light as plant A.
In excerpt 2 data was presented to her that showed that plant B had indeed
grown much. Her interpretation of this data was directed by her first
hypothesis and because the data disconfirmed it, the next hypothesis is
claiming there might be some error source in the experiment. Hence the
misinterpretation did not result in a direct confirmation of the previous
hypothesis, instead it lay the basis for a denial of a disconfirmation, or an
explanation for why the first hypothesis did not hold even though she still thinks
it should.

<!--l. 17--><p class="noindent" >As the students were done with the textbook chapter of photosynthesis and had
connected theoretical explanations to phenomenas such as growth, the
presumptions of the outcomes to the experiment colored the interpretation of data
because it was connected to the students conceptual knowledge. Siri knew that
plants makes food for themselves by doing photosynthesis. To do photosynthesis,
a green plant such as the cress in the experiment need light of wavelengths other
than green (blue and red). This reasoning is enabled in Siri because she know a
lot of the scientific concepts concerning the theme at hand. We can say that
the inquiry process became deductive as it was affected by the students
preconceptions and their ability to explain the observations they made with
Monoplant.
<!--l. 19--><p class="indent" >   This relates to misconceptions in inquiry learning, and what <a 
href="#Xgomez2008elementary">Gomez-Zwiep</a>&#x00A0;(<a 
href="#Xgomez2008elementary">2008</a>)
refers to as inconsistent understanding according to what the teacher intended. In
this case Siris conception of photosynthesis, which in the context of the textbook
examples makes sense, becomes a misconception when she is confronted with a
plant that germinates. Hence it leads her to erroneous conclusions. <a

illustrate what we can see in the students inquiry: the context of the plant in the
experiment is new for the students, therefore making it difficult for the students to
apply their prior knowledge to the phenomena.
<!--l. 26--><p class="indent" >   We have now established that the inquiry process is influenced by the fact that
the students have a certain knowledge about photosynthesis. This can at one hand
lead to misconceptions due to the students having a great freedom to pursue their

<!--l. 35--><p class="noindent" >During the inquiry process the students were presented with different
representations of the photosynthesis phenomenon. In this section we will
give account for how they were used in the inquiry process and how they
complimented each other. We will also look at differences in the students&#8217;
language when engaging with the different representations. To recap,
our second research question is as follows: &#8221;How does Monoplant, by
presenting photosynthesis differently from the text book, support the inquiry
process?&#8221;
<!--l. 37--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.2.1   </span> <a 
 id="x1-190002.2.1"></a>Complementary processes</h4>
<!--l. 39--><p class="noindent" >When reviewing the literature used in the science education, we found that the
scientific concepts are largely represented in a theoretical manner. In the first
paragraph of the chapter concerning photosynthesis, scientific words such as
&#8221;pigments&#8221;, &#8221;chloroplasts&#8221; and &#8221;glucose&#8221; appears. Later on, the concept is
explained by its chemical formula and the chapter rarely gives any examples of
how photosynthesis affects the life of plants concretely. The textbook therefore
emphasizes how photosynthesis fits into a larger system of scientific concepts, and
is more concerned with conveying the big picture than the specific and concrete
experiences.
<!--l. 42--><p class="indent" >   Monoplant on the other hand affords a more inductive or &#8221;bottom-up&#8221;
approach. As a learning resource, Monoplant is a tool for exploring ideas related
to photosynthesis. The variables relevant for the plant&#8217;s photosynthesis are
mediated through graphs and videos, but leaving the interpretation of these data
in the hands of the students. The system is only concerned with one plant in one
                                                                          

                                                                          
specific context, and not trying to generalize from the specific results to a larger
scientific concept.
<!--l. 44--><p class="indent" >   When looking at our data with this in mind, a pattern in the students&#8217;
language emerge. During the inquiry process, students use everyday language
when engaging with Monoplant. An example comes from excerpt 10 where Siri
says that the plant &#8221;use moisture from the earth&#8221;. Another example is from
excerpt 7 where students use concepts as &#8221;pop out&#8221;, &#8221;capture&#8221; and &#8221;use
sunlight&#8221;. All of these concepts have their scientific counterpart which
is represented in the textbook, but when discussing among themselves,
the students choose to talk about the phenomenon in a &#8221;non-academic&#8221;
way.
<!--l. 46--><p class="indent" >   However, the students language seem to change when engaging with
representations linked to the textbook. An example of this is from excerpt 8 where
Siri use scientific concepts such as &#8221;chlorophyll molecule&#8221; and &#8221;excited&#8221; when
looking at a textbook illustration of photosynthesis.
<!--l. 48--><p class="indent" >   An explanation of the change in language may be given by applying
<a 
href="#Xvygotsky2012thought">Vygotsky</a>&#x00A0;(<a 
href="#Xvygotsky2012thought">2012</a>) theory of spontaneous and scientific concepts as presented in
chapter <a 
href="#x1-80001.1.5">1.1.5<!--tex4ht:ref: cha:spontaneous_scientific --></a> on page <a 
href="#x1-80001.1.5">11<!--tex4ht:ref: cha:spontaneous_scientific --></a>. When engaging with Monoplant, the students are
addressing concrete results in a concrete experiment in a specific context. The
concepts they use are therefore linked to what they are observing. When Siri
says that the plant &#8221;use sunlight&#8221;, it is because this is something he has
experience with. She knows that the sun transfers energy that plants make
use of, and she has perhaps seen plants die as a result of receiving no
light. This is an example of a spontaneous concept (<a 
href="#Xvygotsky2012thought">Vygotsky</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xvygotsky2012thought">2012</a>) - &#8221;a
nonconscious and nonsystematic&#8221; concept. Spontaneous concepts have
their strength in explaining what concerns the situation, empirical and
practical (<a 
href="#Xvygotsky2012thought">Vygotsky</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xvygotsky2012thought">2012</a>), and are therefore deemed fit to mediate the
student&#8217;s thoughts when discussing the plant on the screen in front of
them.
<!--l. 52--><p class="indent" >   Yet we see from excerpt 8 that the same student also use the scientific concept
&#8221;excite electrons&#8221; when describing the same phenomenon but interacting with the
textbook instead of Monoplant. This is a more abstract concept, but has its
strength in its &#8221;conscious and deliberate character&#8221; (<a 
href="#Xvygotsky2012thought">Vygotsky</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xvygotsky2012thought">2012</a>). An
explanation of the change in language may be that the student is not aware of the
two concepts referring to the same phenomenon. She masters the scientific
concept only in the realm of the textbook and the concept&#8217;s relation to
other scientific concepts. And she masters the spontaneous concept only
when referring to the concrete experiments where they have observable
results.
<!--l. 54--><p class="indent" >   Another more plausible explanation would be that in engaging with both
Monoplant and the textbook she has mastered both the scientific and spontaneous
                                                                          

                                                                          
concept of exciting electrons. The spontaneous concept has &#8221;in it&#8217;s slow way
upwards cleared the path for a scientific concept&#8221; (<a 
href="#Xvygotsky2012thought">Vygotsky</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xvygotsky2012thought">2012</a>). The student
is therefore able to speak of &#8221;exciting electrons&#8221; both when talking about the
concrete experiment, and when discussing the experiment in more abstract
terms.
<!--l. 56--><p class="indent" >   Vygotsky states that the &#8221;development of scientific concepts runs ahead of
the development of spontaneous concepts&#8221;. The school has therefore in
this setting supplied the curriculum necessary for the scientific concept
generation. Whereas the students&#8217; inquiry process with Monoplant has
supplied a framework for enriching the scientific concept with personal
experiences.
<!--l. 58--><p class="indent" >   On the other hand, we do not find any evidence of the other participants
mastering the concept of &#8221;exciting electrons&#8221; on the same level as Siri. Yet they
are able to discuss the matter with her using the spontaneous concept. This would
suggest that the other students are not far away from mastering both the scientific
and spontaneous concept. In line with <a 
href="#Xvygotsky2012thought">Vygotsky</a>&#x00A0;(<a 
href="#Xvygotsky2012thought">2012</a>) we will argue that the
control the spontaneous concepts lacks lie within the Zone of Proximal
Development for the other students.
<!--l. 60--><p class="indent" >   We believe our data warrants the assumption that different types of
representations spurs complementary processes that can lead to stronger
concept comprehension among the students. Inquiry-based environments
have their strength in that they provide personal experiences, while more
scientific representations are able to place the phenomenon in a broader
scientific context. As scientific concepts and spontaneous concepts mutually
enrich and are dependent on each other (<a 
href="#Xvygotsky2012thought">Vygotsky</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xvygotsky2012thought">2012</a>). It is important
to take the development of both into account when designing learning
environments.

 id="x1-200002.2.2"></a>Complementary roles</h4>
<!--l. 68--><p class="noindent" >During the inquiry process the students were faced with three fundamentally
different representations of the same phenomenon: the textbook, the physical
plant, and the digital Monoplant system. The textbook consists of textual
representations, along with pictures, illustrations and graphs. The physical plant
is a real-life representation of photosynthesis in action. And the Monoplant system
mediates information such as timelapse-videos that would otherwise be
unavailable in the real world.
<!--l. 70--><p class="indent" >   As pointed out by <a 
href="#Xvan2006supporting">van&#x00A0;der Meij and&#x00A0;de&#x00A0;Jong</a>&#x00A0;(<a 
href="#Xvan2006supporting">2006</a>) there are many benefits
of representing the same phenomenon in multiple ways. First, each of the
                                                                          

                                                                          
representations can show specific aspects of the domain to be learned. Second, one
representation can constrain the interpretation of another representation. And
third, learners can build abstractions by translating between the representations,
which may lead to a deeper understanding of the domain. In our case Monoplant
was used to convey external factors&#8217; effect on photosynthesis. Using both
qualitative information in the form of videos and the physical plant, and
quantitative in the form of graphs.
<!--l. 72--><p class="indent" >   But while the benefits of using MER in education seem obvious, both
<a 
href="#Xainsworth1999functions">Ainsworth</a>&#x00A0;(<a 
href="#Xainsworth1999functions">1999</a>) and <a 
href="#Xvan2006supporting">van&#x00A0;der Meij and&#x00A0;de&#x00A0;Jong</a>&#x00A0;(<a 
href="#Xvan2006supporting">2006</a>) point to problems
students face while undergoing extra tasks related to MER. To exemplify, let us
first take a look at the different representations within the Monoplant
system. The first task the students then have to face, is to understand
the syntax of the representations. E.g. one of the graphs represented is
relative, meaning that the different units of measurement of the sensorvalues
are discarded and replaced with percentage-values. The students then
have to understand what the different axes of the graph represent and
how the variables relates to one another. Second, the students have to
understand which parts of the domain are represented. The system is
designed in such a way that it does not constrain to one specific form of
interaction, and the relation between Monoplant and external factors&#8217; effect on
photosynthesis can therefore be somewhat obscure. And finally, the students
have to understand the relation between the different representations.
E.g. when playing a video file, it is necessary to see it in relation with
the graph to get both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the
phenomenon.
<!--l. 74--><p class="indent" >   In our data we see evidence of the students having problems with the
latter of these tasks: comprehending the relation between the different
representations.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.2.3   </span> <a 
 id="x1-210002.2.3"></a>Representation becomes Misconception</h4>
<!--l. 80--><p class="noindent" >As mentioned earlier, explanations can be accurate enough for one situation but
lead to false conclusions in other situations. (<a 
href="#Xsmith1994misconceptions">Smith&#x00A0;III et&#x00A0;al.</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xsmith1994misconceptions">1994</a>) This is true
for representations and models as well and becomes evident if we look at
Excerpt 6. After looking at the textbook representation which uses the word
&#8221;solar energy&#8221; to label photons, Nora asks &#8221;Can light cause excit.. that
it excites. Or is it just the sun?&#8221;. As the book provides the context to
photosynthesis it mostly frames examples to the nature where sunlight and solar
energy is indeed valid simplifications of photons. But in the case of the
                                                                          

                                                                          
experiments with Monoplant, this simplification is challenged but not
addressed. Monoplant show how much light the plant got, but does not
distinguish what sort of light. The experiments was however designed in
such a way that it differentiated light quality (wavelength of light). Nora
might have interpreted the experiments to address differences to a plant
that have access to solar energy and one which gets another type of light
energy. In any case this is a good example of how an explanation can be
plausible and have explanatory power in one setting, but lead to erroneous
conclusions in another setting. This is also a great example of the need for
scaffolding in an inquiry process, which leads us to the next section........ . .
