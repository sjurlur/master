concepts we will apply in this thesis. First we will introduce the <span

<span 
class="cmti-12">perspective </span>and some key points including <span

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.1   </span> <a 
 id="x1-20001.1"></a>Sociocultural perspective</h3>
<!--l. 13--><p class="noindent" >In a biological sense the human species has not evolved significantly the last ten
thousand years or so. In fact, the biological changes are only minor, and can&#8217;t
explain the difference between modern people and people of the Stone Age. Still
we are able to achieve tasks that would have been impossible for our ancestors
(Säljö,&#x00A0;2001).
<!--l. 15--><p class="indent" >   The explanation of this discrepancy from a sociocultural perspective
becomes evident when one takes into account the <span 
class="cmti-12">tools </span>and <span 
class="cmti-12">signs </span>we use to
mediate the world. We have created a culture where each of the <span 
class="cmti-12">tools </span>and
<span 
class="cmti-12">signs </span>we use has a long history embedded in them. For instance if you are
given the multiplication problem 122<span 
class="tcrm-1200">&#x00D7;</span>284, you can flip up a calculator
and get the answer instantaneously. Similarly, if you were to solve the
multiplication problem 7<span 
class="tcrm-1200">&#x00D7;</span>4 you can look up in a multiplication table and
find the answer easily. These <span 
class="cmti-12">cultural tools </span>(calculator and multiplication
table) enables you to make sense of the world in a different way than our
ancestors.
<!--l. 17--><p class="indent" >   From the example given above we can see that there is an &#8220;irreducible
tension&#8221; between the agent and the cultural tool (Wertsch,&#x00A0;1998). Without the
multiplication table I would not be able to solve the problem. But the
multiplication table is not enough, as it would have been useless without a skilled
user. The goal of a sociocultural approach is therefore to:
<!--l. 19--><p class="indent" >
      <div class="quote">
      <!--l. 20--><p class="noindent" >&#8221;Create an account of human mental processes that recognizes the
      essential relationship between these processes and their cultural,
      historical, and institutional setting.&#8221;(Wertsch,&#x00A0;1998)</div>
<!--l. 23--><p class="indent" >   This means that the unit of analysis is human action, and how it is mediated
by cultural tools, or &#8220;agent-acting-with-mediational-means&#8221; (Wertsch et&#x00A0;al.,&#x00A0;1993
cited in&#x00A0;Wertsch,&#x00A0;1998). This we are emphasizes the holism of the sociocultural
approach. The mediated action can never be understood by the properties of only
the agent or the mediational means. An example of this is H<sub><span 
class="cmr-8">2</span></sub>O: one can never
                                                                          

                                                                          
understand what makes up water if one analyses hydrogen and oxygen separately.
The characteristic of the whole is not made up by the characteristics of the
elements (Vygotski&#x012D; et&#x00A0;al.,&#x00A0;1978). Another example is the track-and-field event of
pole vaulting.
      <div class="quote">
      <!--l. 25--><p class="noindent" >&#8221;The pole by itself does not magically propel vaulters over a cross
      bar; it must be used skillfully by the agent. At the same time, an
      agent without a pole or with an inappropriate pole is incapable
      of participating in the event&#8221; (Wertsch,&#x00A0;1998).</div>
<!--l. 27--><p class="noindent" >So while analysis of the elements in isolation may be informative, we will never
understand the big picture without taking into account the relation between the
mediational means and the agent.
<!--l. 29--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.1.1   </span> <a 
 id="x1-30001.1.1"></a>Tools &amp; Signs</h4>
<!--l. 30--><p class="noindent" >One important distinction to make when talking about mediated activity is that
of tools (physical tools) and signs (psychological tools) (Vygotski&#x012D; et&#x00A0;al.,&#x00A0;1978).
While they are similar in that they can play a mediating role in activity, they are
different in the ways they orient human behavior. The tool is externally
oriented and must lead to change in physical objects. A basic example of a
tool is a hammer. An agent can mediate her activity toward the external
world by using the tool to crush a coconut. A sign on the other hand is
internally oriented and &#8220;changes nothing in the object of psychological
operation&#8221; (Vygotski&#x012D; et&#x00A0;al.,&#x00A0;1978). Examples of signs are: diagrams,
drawings, language, or as mentioned above, multiplication tables. &#8220;It
is a means of internal activity aimed at mastering oneself&#8221; (Vygotski&#x012D;
et&#x00A0;al.,&#x00A0;1978).
<!--l. 32--><p class="indent" >   Another illuminating example of the difference between tools and signs is that
of a child presented with a birthday cake. The child does not immediately start
eating, but waits until &#8220;happy birthday&#8221; has been sung and she has blown out the
candles. In that sense the cake is a sign as it represent a lot more than just food
in the mind of the child. It signifies that she is a year older, that she
is going to get presents afterwards, that she is celebrated, etc. On the
other hand, from the parents&#8217; point of view, the cake can be used as a
tool to signify that she is a year older and has new responsibilities in the
society.
                                                                          

                                                                          
<!--l. 34--><p class="indent" >   If we look at the same example from a behavioristic point of view, another
situation emerge. The behavioristic model focuses on the role of the individual
and the notion that knowledge arises through individual drill and practice. The
girl would therefore know from previous experience that cake tastes good, and
immediately start to dig in.
<!--l. 36--><p class="indent" >   In contrast, the cognitive model focuses on thought processes and the notion
that the environment provides raw material for testing innately conceived
hypotheses. The reason for the girl not eating the cake would therefore be an
internal processes in the mind of the girl and the context in which the cake is
placed would play a minor role.
<!--l. 38--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.1.2   </span> <a 
 id="x1-40001.1.2"></a>Implications for Learning</h4>
<!--l. 39--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;From a sociocultural perspective learning is understood as mastery and
appropriation of cultural tools&#8221; (Wertsch, 1998, Säljö, 1999, 2001, cited in Mifsud
and&#x00A0;Mørch,&#x00A0;2010). Wertsch&#x00A0;(1998) does however makes a distinction between
knowing how to use a cultural tool (mastery) and making a cultural tool one&#8217;s
own (appropriation). Appropriation can be to take the mastery one step further.
Oxford dictionary defines it as &#8220;the action of taking something for one&#8217;s own use&#8221;,
or as Wertsch&#x00A0;(1998) puts it &#8220;making a cultural tool one&#8217;s own&#8221;. One
example of this is a person who has mastered the cultural tool &#8221;chords&#8221; on
a guitar and later appropriates them to a song. It should however be
recognized that both mastery and appropriation does not always happen. For
example, a person could master the chords on the guitar and perform them
flawlessly in class, but dismiss them as terribly ugly at home. Likewise, a
person can appropriate chords to a song without mastering the chords
themselves.
<!--l. 41--><p class="indent" >   When we then ask what learning is from a sociocultural perspective, we are
also asking &#8220;&#8216;which cultural tools are valued?&#8217;, and &#8216;In which contexts do they
apply&#8217;&#8221; (Mifsud and&#x00A0;Mørch,&#x00A0;2010). In order to give an answer to these questions,
we have to take into account the cultural, historical and institutional context of
the mediated activity.
<!--l. 43--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.1.3   </span> <a 
 id="x1-50001.1.3"></a>Social practices</h4>
<!--l. 44--><p class="noindent" >As mentioned before, with a sociocultural perspective on learning, we see external
and internal processes as intertwined. By this we try to see student interactions
with artefacts and each other as embedded in a cultural, historical and
                                                                          

                                                                          
institutional practice, meaning that we take into account the relation between the
mediational means and the agent. These practices can be embedded into cultural
artefacts or as Furberg&#x00A0;(2009) states: &#8221;computer based environments can embed
such practices in the design&#8221;. She mentions two types of social practices
embedded in Web-based inquiry learning environments: <span 
class="cmti-12">scientific inquiry </span>and
<span 
class="cmti-12">institutional practices</span>. Scientific inquiry is often expressed by encouraging
students to do ideal scientific activities e.g. hypothesis generation, evaluating
evidence and constructing explanations. Institutional practices is expressed in
terms of school science as an institutional practice, for example by means of tools
that enable the teacher to supervise the students or tools for the students to test
their own skills. These &#8221;embedded institutional practices can be, and often are, at
odds with the ideal practices of scientific inquiry.&#8221; (Chinn and&#x00A0;Malhotra,&#x00A0;2002,
referenced in Furberg,&#x00A0;2009)
<!--l. 46--><p class="indent" >   Likewise Jimenez-Aleixandre et&#x00A0;al.&#x00A0;(2000) pose that &#8221;doing science&#8221; has an
obstacle named &#8221;doing school&#8221;. Where &#8221;doing science&#8221; refers to argumentation or
dialog characterized by &#8220;construction, representation, evaluation of knowledge
claims and investigative methods&#8221; (Jimenez-Aleixandre et&#x00A0;al.,&#x00A0;2000). While
&#8221;doing school&#8221; refers to what actions and activities students and teachers do that
instantiates rituals, routines and expectations in educational settings, e.g. review
homework assignments, take lecture notes, take tests, complete lab activities etc.
Jimenez-Aleixandre et&#x00A0;al. have contributed to the understanding of students
argumentation and knowledge claims, but as Furberg and&#x00A0;Ludvigsen&#x00A0;(2008)
suggests; a more holistic view is needed to get a rich understanding of the
complexity of students&#8217; meaning making. Meaning that both the dimension of
&#8221;doing school&#8221; and the dimension of &#8221;doing science&#8221; needs to be taken into
account.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.1.4   </span> <a 
 id="x1-60001.1.4"></a>Zone of Proximal Development</h4>
<!--l. 49--><p class="noindent" >Vygotski&#x012D; was concerned with the relationship between learning and development,
and argues that the theorists of his time such as Piaget, James and Koffka does
not provide an adequate view of this. With his sociocultural perspective he finds
that learning and development are interrelated, and that this relationship has
some specific applications in school-learning. (Vygotski&#x012D; et&#x00A0;al.,&#x00A0;1978, p. 84) Thus,
in order to describe these issues he introduces the concept Zone of Proximal
Development (ZPD), and defines it as follows:
<!--l. 51--><p class="indent" >
      <div class="quote">
                                                                          

                                                                          
      <!--l. 51--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;The  distance  between  the  actual  developmental  level  as
      determined  by  independent  problem  solving  and  the  level  of
      &#8221;potential development&#8221; as determined through problem solving
      under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers&#8221;
      (Vygotski&#x012D; et&#x00A0;al.,&#x00A0;1978, p. 86)</div>
<!--l. 54--><p class="indent" >   The actual developmental level is in other words determined by looking at
what a person can do alone. Vygotski&#x012D; found that this traditional way of
determining a person&#8217;s mental development did not hold in school-learning, as it
only describes what functions in a person that have already been matured. He
therefore introduces a new developmental level, the &#8221;potential development&#8221;,
which can describe the functions in a person that are in the process of maturation.
The actual development of a person is therefore the end product of developing,
while the potential development is the state and process of developing.
The ZPD can be used as a tool by teachers and instructors to delineate
the immediate future of their students, i.e., their actual development of
tomorrow.
<!--l. 56--><p class="indent" >   Vygotski&#x012D; proposes further that ZPD is an essential feature of learning, which
distinguishes learning from development, but at the same time provokes
developmental processes that would not be possible without learning. In other
words,
<!--l. 58--><p class="indent" >
      <div class="quote">
      <!--l. 58--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;It awakens a variety of internal developmental processes that are
      able to operate only when the child is interacting with people in
      his environment and in cooperation with his peers.&#8221; (Vygotski&#x012D;
      et&#x00A0;al.,&#x00A0;1978, p. 90)</div>
<!--l. 61--><p class="indent" >   By applying the ZPD to learning-situations, the key takeaway is that the
analysis alters the traditional view of knowledge or mastery, and shows that
the constructed knowledge provides the basis for further development. A
great example of this is the process of mastering native language, which
initially is learned as a means of communication between the child and
other people. The use of language first happens on a social level, in the
interaction with people, and is later developed to internal speech and
becomes a mean to organize thought, i.e., an internal mental function
(Vygotski&#x012D; et&#x00A0;al.,&#x00A0;1978, p. 89). Vygotski&#x012D; calls this concept the <span 
class="cmti-12">duality of</span>
<span 
class="cmti-12">learning</span>.
<!--l. 63--><p class="indent" >   Another classic example is that of a child trying to grasp a ball. At first the
gesture means nothing to the child, but when the mother realizes that the gesture
                                                                          

                                                                          
indicates something, the situation changes dramatically. When she gives him the
ball, as a result of the hand gesture, the &#8221;grasping movement changes to the act of
pointing&#8221; (Vygotski&#x012D; et&#x00A0;al.,&#x00A0;1978). This means that the operation that
was initially an external activity is now &#8221;reconstructed and begins to
occur internally&#8221; (Vygotski&#x012D; et&#x00A0;al.,&#x00A0;1978). Thus, <span 
class="cmti-12">externalization </span>precedes
<span 
class="cmti-12">internalization</span>.
<!--l. 65--><p class="indent" >   With this in mind, a teacher can understand what developmental processes is
maturing in their students, and from that give adapted challenges, show solutions
and in general tailor what to teach next. From this perspective, development is
lagging behind learning, and the challenge for the teacher becomes to teach ahead
of development, but at the same time not too far ahead. This leads us to
the concept of scaffolding, which can be argued to be a refinement of
ZPD.
<!--l. 67--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.1.5   </span> <a 
 id="x1-70001.1.5"></a>Scaffolding</h4>
<!--l. 68--><p class="noindent" >Vygotski&#x012D;&#8217;s Zone of Proximal Development is the distance between what a person
can do alone and what he can do with help from a More Knowledgeable Other
(MKO). What types of help and how the MKO should provide it, has
not been a focal point for Vygotski&#x012D;. Although David Wood does not
reference to any Vygotski&#x012D;an terms, the term scaffolding introduced by
Wood in 1976, bears resemblance to the very idea of ZPD. As Wood puts
it:
<!--l. 70--><p class="indent" >
      <div class="quote">
      <!--l. 70--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Scaffolding  consist  essentially  of  the  adult  &#8216;controlling&#8217;  those
      elements  of  the  task  that  are  initially  beyond  the  learner&#8217;s
      capacity, thus permitting him to concentrate upon and complete
      only those elements that are within his range of competence&#8221;
      (Wood et&#x00A0;al.,&#x00A0;1976)</div>
<!--l. 73--><p class="indent" >   Thus, scaffolding can be applied by MKOs in order to keep the learning
process within the learner&#8217;s ZPD. There is a is a nuanced balance for how much
guiding is needed and a key point is that a person&#8217;s ZPD is personal, thus a
scaffold should be personally adjusted. An example can be if we were
to teach two persons how to take a picture with a professional DSLR
camera, one being an old woman (Mary) with little insight in technology,
the other a young man (Ryan) who has grown up with technology. It is
                                                                          

                                                                          
obvious that the two persons have different cultural backgrounds and taking
a picture have different meanings to them, hence the tutoring of them
need to be differently tailored. In the following section we will go through
the six steps of scaffolding provided by Wood et&#x00A0;al.&#x00A0;(1976) using this
example.
<!--l. 75--><p class="indent" >
      <ol  class="enumerate1" >
      <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-7002x1"> <span 
class="cmti-12">Recruitment </span>- We need to get the learners attention and interest in the
      task at hand. In our case this could be to show nice pictures of Mary&#8217;s
      grandchildren to make her interested in taking nice pictures of them
      herself. For Ryan we could show the difference between pictures taken
      with an iPhone and a DSLR camera to make him understand the value
      of using a DSLR versus his iPhone.
      </li>
      <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-7004x2"> <span 
class="cmti-12">Reduction in degrees of freedom </span>- The task must be narrowed down in
      order to provide a clear goal that can be reached. For Mary we can say
      that her task is to take a photo of her grandson playing in the garden
      with the use of auto-mode. And for Ryan, the task could be to take a
      landscape photo of his favorite view for his Facebook cover photo with
      the camera setting called A for aperture, which lets him control the
      depth of field - an important setting when photographing landscapes.
      </li>
      <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-7006x3"> <span 
class="cmti-12">Direction  maintenance  </span>-  The  learners  must  be  kept  on  the  path
      towards the goal, which implies a focus on motivation. Both to maintain
      progression and to keep a focus on the goal. From this point, scaffolding
      becomes an improvisation skill and it can be hard to plan ahead because
      of all the unforeseen things that can happen. Ryan can for example
      stop  focusing  on  the  landscape  photo  and  instead  take  pictures  of
      a  car.  While  Mary  starts  looking  at  the  pictures  contained  on  the
      camera&#8217;s memory stick. In this case one has to evaluate the goal versus
      the reduction in degrees of freedom. It might be that Ryan is more
      interested in taking pictures of cars, and since the main goal is to learn
      to take photos with a DSLR camera, an adjustment of the end product
      can be done. In Mary&#8217;s case however, she might be easily distracted,
      and just needs someone to tell her to focus on taking pictures of her
      grandson. These are nuances that can be hard to spot, and requires a
      tutor with good improvisation skills.
      </li>
                                                                          

                                                                          
      <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-7008x4"> <span 
class="cmti-12">Marking critical features </span>- Marking what the learner has done versus
      what is expected. This could be to show Mary that in her picture, she
      has left half her grandson&#8217;s head out of the picture, and that she should
      try to capture a photo with the whole face visible. For Ryan it could be
      to point out that he has a very small depth of field in his photo, putting
      the trees in the foreground into focus, while leaving the mountains in
      the background blurred. Examples of correct solutions could be used to
      demonstrate the discrepancies between what the learner has produced
      and a correct solution.
      </li>
      <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-7010x5"> <span 
class="cmti-12">Frustration control </span>- Balancing the dependency of the tutor and the
      independent problem solving. Mary should be given some space to try
      taking photos, but we should at the same time be observant of when
      guiding or telling is needed. We could tell her to have the sun behind her
      to get the right light conditions, and hold the camera with two hands.
      The major risk here, is that the learner can become too dependent
      of the tutor, making it harder for the learner to achieve the goal, i.e.
      taking a picture alone at a later time.
      </li>
      <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-7012x6"> <span 
class="cmti-12">Demonstration </span>- Showing a solution to the task, imitating the learner&#8217;s
      earlier attempts and possibly correcting errors, with a hope that the
      learner will imitate back in a more correct manner. For Mary we could
      take a picture of her grandson, imitating her position, look for the sun,
      and then correct the position to get the sun behind us. Or for Ryan we
      could place the camera on a chair and use a timer to reduce movement
      in the camera, thereby allowing a slower shutter speed, which again
      allows a higher aperture, increasing the depth of field, giving focus to
      both the trees in the foreground and the mountains in the background.
      This might be supplemented by telling, to provide a context to the
      tutor&#8217;s actions.</li></ol>
<!--l. 89--><p class="indent" >   We have now exemplified an application of scaffolding in a learning process.
These steps can either be carried out manually by a tutor, or be mediated
automatically by a computer-based system. Furberg&#x00A0;(2009) presents one
implementation of a computer mediated scaffold where prompts requiring
user-input are used to promote student reflection. Another example is
from Fischer et&#x00A0;al.&#x00A0;(1991) where a critiquing system that gives the user a
&#8221;reasoned opinion about a product or action generated by a human&#8221; is
described.
<!--l. 91--><p class="indent" >   As presented, some of these steps require planning while others require
                                                                          

                                                                          
improvisation. Both the planning and improvisation turns out to be tailored to
the specific situation at hand with all the complex contexts the learners bring
with them to the situation. Even though the six steps provided by Wood
et&#x00A0;al.&#x00A0;(1976) can be considered as a framework for scaffolding, it is still quite
complex and demands careful consideration by the teacher or the designers of the
computer based scaffold.

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.2   </span> <a 
 id="x1-80001.2"></a>Multiple External Representations</h3>
<!--l. 94--><p class="noindent" >Multiple external representations (MER) have been used since long before the
advent of computers for conveying information. Textbooks and manuals
often contain images and illustrations, maps show different information in
different ways, and whiteboards are used in addition to speech. With digital
technology the possibilities of MER are expanded to include dynamic linking
between the representations, and the representations can show dynamic
information that is not available in the real world, e.g., showing the flow of
oxygen.
<!--l. 96--><p class="indent" >   In an effort to identify the features of MER, Ainsworth&#x00A0;(1999) has developed a
classification framework. She suggests that MER can serve primarily three
different purposes in learning situations:
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize"> <span 
class="cmti-12">Complementary roles </span>- Different representations can focus on different
      aspects of the phenomenon under study, or they can contain different
      information  of  the  same  phenomenon.  E.g.  a  topographic  map  in
      addition to a road map.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize"> <span 
class="cmti-12">Constrain interpretation </span>- One representation can be used to constrain
      the interpretation of the other. E.g. the text &#8220;the fork lies next to
      the  spoon&#8221;.  It  is  impossible  to  tell  which  side  the  fork  is  on,  but
      by presenting an illustration of the example, the representation will
      constrain the interpretation of the text.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">  <span 
class="cmti-12">Construct  deeper  understanding  </span>-  MER  can  be  used  to  &#8220;promote
      abstraction,  to  encourage  generalization  and  to  teach  the  relation
      between representations&#8221; (Ainsworth,&#x00A0;1999).</li></ul>
<!--l. 103--><p class="indent" >   The three different roles presented above are also the benefits of using MER.
                                                                          

                                                                          
Complementary roles can support students to make up for insufficient knowledge
of one representation by using another, constrain interpretation can &#8220;support the
learners&#8217; reasoning about the less familiar representation&#8221; Ainsworth&#x00A0;(1999), and
finally the learners can gain deeper understanding of the domain by translating
between representations (van&#x00A0;der Meij and&#x00A0;de&#x00A0;Jong,&#x00A0;2006).
<!--l. 105--><p class="indent" >   On the other hand, when learners are faced with MER they must also
undertake additional tasks as to understand the phenomenon or domain in
question. This may lead to a heavy cognitive load, which &#8220;may leave less
resources for actual learning&#8221; (Sweller, 1988, 1989, referenced in van&#x00A0;der Meij
and&#x00A0;de&#x00A0;Jong,&#x00A0;2006). A key issue is then to reduce the cost for learners associated
with MER, while keeping the benefits.

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.3   </span> <a 
 id="x1-90001.3"></a>Inquiry learning</h3>
<!--l. 108--><p class="noindent" >According to Prince and&#x00A0;Felder&#x00A0;(2006) science has traditionally been
taught in a <span 
class="cmti-12">deductive </span>manner. In the same way as Sherlock Holmes collects
piece by piece to form a theory, the students collect pieces of models and
illustrations to grasp a scientific concept. Little attention is paid to why
the students should learn the material, apart from having to perform on
tests.
<!--l. 110--><p class="indent" >   On the other hand we have the <span 
class="cmti-12">inductive </span>ways of teaching and learning.
Instead of beginning with the theory, the students are presented with some sort of
task, which becomes the motivation to learn the tools required to solve the task.
Examples of this can be to make a battery in a science class, or finding out why
potato-chips bags seem more inflated on the top of a mountain than by the
sea.
<!--l. 112--><p class="indent" >   Inquiry learning involves giving the students &#8221;questions to be answered,
problems to be solved, or a set of observations to be explained&#8221; (Prince
and&#x00A0;Felder,&#x00A0;2006), or in other words: giving the students incentives to ask for
information. There are several other inductive learning methods, such as
problem-based learning, discovery learning and project-based learning, which all
can be explained with the same statements as inquiry learning. Inquiry learning
can therefore be seen as an umbrella term for inductive learning methods. (Prince
and&#x00A0;Felder,&#x00A0;2006)
<!--l. 114--><p class="indent" >   Staver and&#x00A0;Bay (1987, referenced in Prince and&#x00A0;Felder,&#x00A0;2006) differentiates
between <span 
class="cmti-12">structured inquiry </span>(e.g. tutorials), <span 
class="cmti-12">guided inquiry </span>and <span 
class="cmti-12">open inquiry</span>. This
relates to the ZPD and scaffolding. Depending on the student&#8217;s developmental
level, different framings of the inquiry process is needed. To scaffold the
inquiry learning process is not an easy task. In a review article, De&#x00A0;Jong
                                                                          

                                                                          
and&#x00A0;Van&#x00A0;Joolingen&#x00A0;(1998) identify four problems that learners may encounter
when engaging with inquiry learning: <span 
class="cmti-12">hypothesis generation</span>, <span 
class="cmti-12">design of experiments</span>,
<span 
class="cmti-12">interpretation of data</span>, and <span 
class="cmti-12">regulation of learning</span>. They continue to argue for the
need of supporting students during the process of scientific inquiry, providing
scaffolds for each of these problems. The challenge then becomes &#8221;guiding
students to the &#8220;right&#8221; path, but at the same time letting them discover and make
the discovery their own.&#8221; (Kluge and&#x00A0;Bakken,&#x00A0;2010, p. 247). In other words the
students need to be steered towards the interesting discoveries, but at the
same time have the freedom to explore and not be commanded in any
way.
<!--l. 117--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.3.1   </span> <a 
 id="x1-100001.3.1"></a>Misconceptions</h4>
<!--l. 118--><p class="noindent" >Misconceptions appear in most educational contexts. According to
Gomez-Zwiep&#x00A0;(2008) students have &#8221;qualitative differences in his or her
understanding of science that is often inconsistent with what the teacher
intended through his or her instruction&#8221;. These are often deeply rooted, and
remain intact even after instruction. This becomes especially relevant when
dealing with inductive learning methods, as the students are given more
freedom to explore their own ideas, and thus more freedom to pursue
tracks that may lead to different conclusions than the ones intended by the
instructor.
<!--l. 120--><p class="indent" >   The term itself has been given many labels in research literature, depending on
the focus: &#8221;alternative frameworks&#8221;, &#8221;preconceptions&#8221;, and &#8221;student ideas&#8221; are
just some of them. An important factor here is how misconceptions are
perceived. Are they resources for learning, or obstacles that the learner has to
overcome? If we look at meaning making from a constructivist point of view,
advanced knowledge is built upon prior understanding. Misconceptions then
become &#8221;faulty extensions of productive prior knowledge&#8221; (Smith&#x00A0;III
et&#x00A0;al.,&#x00A0;1994).
<!--l. 122--><p class="indent" >   To then simply write misconceptions off as mistakes is, according to
Smith&#x00A0;III et&#x00A0;al.&#x00A0;(1994), a too narrow view in their role in learning. If we take
the example of stating that &#8221;multiplication makes numbers larger&#8221;, it is
indeed an accurate explanation of most multiplication pieces. The problem
arises in the few cases where we multiply by non-natural numbers. The
conception that leads to erroneous conclusions in some contexts can be quite
useful in others (Smith&#x00A0;III et&#x00A0;al.,&#x00A0;1994). The misconceptions are therefore
for the students &#8221;conceptions in their own right with plausibility and
at explanatory power&#8221; (Smith, diSessa &amp; Roschelle 1993, referenced in
                                                                          

                                                                          
Larkin,&#x00A0;2012).
